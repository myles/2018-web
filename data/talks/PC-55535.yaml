talk_abstract: "There's a telescope that sits on a mountaintop in the Chilean desert––it's job is to capture and help scientists understand the dark matter of our universe. But this isn't a talk just about dark matter, it's about discovering fleeting supernovas in space, while discovering the world of Python."

talk_details: "When you're new to a programming language, they tell you to find a problem that will keep your interest. One year, and 1 million images of space later, we now have the best model for classifying supernovas. The funny thing is, it's actually pretty easy––thanks to Python's open source and data science world.

This talk is a quick walk-through of lessons learned while developing with Python, and proving that writing supernova detection code isn't just for astronomers."
