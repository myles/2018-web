You gain 26 xp.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e You enter a large interior space with stone walls and a high stone ceiling. Torches flicker in wall brackets. A large self-referential tapestry hanging on the north wall shows a guild workshop full of happy weavers busily weaving the very tapestry in which they are depicted. There are exits to the east, west, and south.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e Linden, another player, is here.\r\n\u003e Gwyrian, another player, is here.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e  \u003esay Hi\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e You say “Hi”\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e Gwyrian says “Hey!

In your technical or documentation project, how can you get the right people interested and involved? How can you keep those people happily engaged until the work is done? Is there anything you can do to prevent griefing… err, “interpersonal difficulties” from causing delays? And why do some people seem to thrive in an environment with poor documentation and how can you encourage them to participate in effectively documenting everything anyway?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll explore ways to accomplish these aims, using strategies drawn from “Player Type Theory”. For 20 years, this theory has been employed by game designers to encourage stable long-term play communities in online multiplayer games. These are strategies that I have used successfully in my workplace and they can work for you too.",
    "notes": "This talk originally came about as a result of reading I was doing for my Master's degree and noticing the ways in which various game design and community research offered insights into the work I was doing as a technical writer and administrator of BCIT's Knowledge Base, responsible for wrangling documentation from a wide variety of folks in various positions at BCIT. I recognized that some of the strategies that these theories proposed were ones I was already using to get the best documentation out of the most experienced people, and that led me to test whether other proposed strategies might work to elicit certain behaviours within my work environment similar to the way they might in a game environment. I had some success with this and wanted to share that success with others, in addition to offering the idea that there are always new ways to look at a problem.\r\n\r\nTechnically, all I need for this talk is a projector.",

    "description": "How difficult is it to build an own intelligent application? When you hear “artificial intelligence” you might think of complex solutions as self-driving cars, autonomous drones and robots or smart assistants as Alexa or Siri - but it doesn’t have to be that complex. You can build a powerful image classification model within a topic that inspires and interests you - with 3 easy steps. First, find a topic that interests you; it can be something that inspires you, excites you or a super simple day-to-day problem you’re facing. Which of your skills are matching your interests and other topics that excites you? Use that skill set to the next step, which is creating your own data.\r\n\r\nMy day-to-day repetitive problem was the daily makeup routine; it takes time and its quite uninspiring but when you finally decide to try something new - you literally get over 30 million results when search for “makeup tutorial” on Youtube and beauty being a $400 billion industry indicates that makeup play a significant part of people’s lives. How do you even know what makeup style will look as good on you as it does on all the YouTubers?\r\n\r\nTherefore I built my very first machine learning algorithm which tells you which eye shape you have and suggests makeup styles matching your particular eye shape to enhances your features. You just snap a photo of your eyes in the app and the algorithm does the rest; telling you which eye shape you have and what makeup style that suits your particular eye shape. I build this app with 3 easy steps and I’m excited to show how you can build yourself an own powerful image classification model, with your own data, within a topic that inspires and interests you. It might sound difficult but I can’t wait to show you how few lines of Python you need to build the whole app.\r\n\r\nWhat repetitive and categorizing tasks are you regularly facing? Bring your interests, passion and everyday problems and we’ll explore a more widespread adoption of artificial intelligence solutions.",
    "notes": "I’m a 30-year-old self-taught data scientist and entrepreneur from Sweden living in San Francisco (@espressocodes on Instagram). \r\nMy talk would fit a 30-minute talk and the essence is to encourage a more widespread exploration of artificial intelligence solutions.\r\n\r\nBesides from the own startup, I’m working with a research team where we are applying artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities on biomedical science to solve big health problems. My passion and mission is to accelerate the development of new technologies that will help doctors to cure, prevent and manage diseases.\r\n\r\nThe aim with this talk is to encourage and inspire to get new ideas on implementing data science on day-to-day problems. The purpose is also to show how easy it is to build yourself an own powerful image classification model in Python, with your own data, within a topic that inspires and interests you. I’m eager to show how few lines of code can get you a whole application and the focus with this talk is to concrete and showing code examples while walking through the machine learning parts and giving some basic background to deep learning.\r\n\r\nI’ve built an image classification model in Python which is able to recognize your eye shape with convolutional neural networks and by that recommend different makeup styles that suits your particular eye shape. The idea is sprung from my daily makeup routine; it takes time and its quite uninspiring but when you finally decide to try something new you get over 30 million results searching for “makeup tutorial” on Youtube and beauty being a $400 billion industry indicates that makeup play a significant part of people’s lives. How do you know what makeup style will look as good on you as it does on all the YouTubers? The model I built is trained on various images that I annotated myself and is built using very simple convolutional neural networks with a pre-trained model (VGG16) fine-tuned on my annotated data. The results are a model with ~90% accuracy so I decided to take it further and built an app that can inspire others.\r\n\r\nYou just snap a photo with your webcam or smartphone at the web app and the algorithm tells you which shape you have + suggests makeup styles matching your eye shape to enhances your features. The app itself is built in Flask, a simple Python web server framework, which orchestrates the backend and communicates with the frontend and trained neural network.\r\n\r\nThe three steps of the talk consist of first deciding on an interest, passion or day-to-day problem, secondly how to create data based on the interest or experience and lastly training a model. I built this classification model with very little experience and the emphasis of this talk is to inform that it is possible to get state of the art results on niches which lack data and that it still exists “low having fruits” in numerous verticals.\r\n\r\nThe essence of the talk is to encourage and inspire to implement data science on niches and verticals that aligns with your own interests.\r\n",

Authors typically hide their identity through nicknames, however they have no protection against attribution techniques. This talk will present attacks on Python developers identity and discuss protection methods.",
    "description": "The rapid increase in open source software is an attestation of a new standard in software development. Today over 80 percent of any software code is open source, according to a recent study by Sonatype. Python replaced Java as the second-most popular language on GitHub, with 40 percent more pull requests opened this year than last by GitHub Inc.'s annual report.\r\n \r\nAs the popularity of open source software increases, so do privacy concerns of individual contributors that often wish to remain anonymous. The majority of open-source repositories (GitHub, Google Code, SourceForge, etc.) allow users to keep their identity private while sharing their code. While in the past it was often sufficient, with the evolution of author attribution technology the question of how private the identity of software developers is becoming increasingly important.\r\n\r\nSoftware author attribution aims to decide who wrote a computer program, given its source or binary code.  The main premise of this technique lies in the assumption that programmers unconsciously tend to use the same coding patterns. These patterns comprised of a number of distinctive features allow to characterise a programmer’s style and uniquely identify his/her works. Applications of software author attribution are wide and include software forensics - where the analyst wants to determine the author of a program given a set of potential programmers, plagiarism detection - where the analyst wants to identify illicit code reuse, ghostwriting detection - where given a suspicious piece of code the analysis wants to determine if it has been plagiarized from one of the programs in a given set, and in general any scenario where software ownership needs to be determined.\r\n\r\nIn this session we will show how analysts can identify the author of Python software and how this process can be deceiving. We present two attacks on current attribution systems: author imitation and author hiding. The first attack can be applied on Python developer's identity in open-source projects. The attack transforms syntactical representation of attacker’s source code to a version that mimics the victim’s coding style while retaining functionality of original code. This is particularly concerning for Python open-source contributors who are unaware of the fact that by contributing to open-source projects they reveal identifiable information that can be used to their disadvantage. For example, one can easily see that by imitating someone’s coding style it is possible to implicate any software developer in wrongdoing. To resist this attack we discuss multiple approaches of hiding a coding style of Python software author before contribute to open-source.",

    "bio": "I am a recent graduate, and had been conferred with a degree of Bachelors in technology in Computer Science, in August 2018. \r\nI got introduced to the wonders of computer science while pursuing my undergraduate degree, and oh, boy! It was diverse. I was amazed with the profusion of avenues that it opened for me. From natural language chatbots, to  biometrics recognition systems, path-planning robots, I found it ever-so encouraging just to be in the game, and with a curious eye, was ready to unearth it all.\r\nI can program in multiple languages, Python, C/C++, R, Matlab, Chapel, Java , Python being my first love since freshman days!. I am interested in the fields of NLP, ML, AI, having studied them during my senior year, and I wish to work on  enhancing healthcare with AI. More specifically  I want to work towards making technology come to the the aid of unfortunately or differently abled people, so that they can lead healthy lives. I am inspired by the advancing developments in making computers imitate and understand human language, vision and intelligence and so much more, which I feel can be used to solve challenges that the differently abled people face. \r\nI am an avid reader, an eloquent writer, and love to share my experiences with others as well as learn from others. I do love to talk a lot too. A cup of hot chocolate, my laptop and a problem to code on, is what my daily routine sounds like. This would be my very first time speaking at a tech conference, and I am looking forward to make it worth the time.",

    "description": "With this talk I aim to showcase the use of NetworkX library in Python to unearth various concepts in network science. The study science of networks has become increasingly important owing to various reasons such as:  the spread of social media networks, studying target networks of medicine and drug discovery, and most importantly, our entire human body which is in itself a complex network. It is important to identify Hubs and Authorities in a such a network to identify potential causes of failure, more specifically, in the above examples - to point out, the target region/cell/ of a medicine or to identify whether a medicine could be used to treat multiple illnesses, to identify the origin of rumours in social media networks and also to pinpoint the node from which maximum other nodes can be reached to spread the rumour, and to study our body functions in general. \r\n\r\nThe talk would be mainly divided into the following sections:\r\n- Introduction to Network Science and Applications in daily Lives\r\n\r\n- Networks and their characteristics: Nodes, Degree of a Node, Hubs, Authorities, Topological factors like Clustering Modularity, Betweenness Centrality, Characteristic Path Length, Degree Distribution, Types of Networks such as Small World, Scale Free, and Random networks.\r\n\r\n- Introduction to NetworkX library of Python: Creating Simple networks of various types such as random, real world etc. Finding out the previously mentioned characteristics in (2) using various functions of Networks. \r\n\r\n- The Watts and Strogatz Model: Explaining the evolution of a small world network through code in python (using networkX), Simulations and visualisations.\r\n\r\n- Error and Attack Tolerance of Various Networks:  Explaining the vulnerabilities of various networks through a thorough analysis, again using code in python (using networkX), simulations and various visualisations. Relating it to Disease networks (eg: which nodes should the medicine target to eradicate the disease) and other examples. \r\n",

In addition, this talk is for users of technology themselves, to be able to determine what their rights are with regards to their own data.\r\n\r\nThe only background knowledge this talk requires is that which almost everyone has: some experience being a user of technology which collects data about them.\r\n\r\nAfter watching this talk, developers should be able to determine if their software projects are affected by the new regulations, and should be informed about how their technology will need to change in order to become compliant with the new laws.\r\n\r\n# Outline\r\n\r\n* Introduction\r\n  - Who am I?\r\n  - What is data?\r\n* History of Data Protection Policy \u0026 Practice\r\n  - Germany\r\n  - Sweden\r\n  - United Kingdom\r\n* Present Day\r\n  - European Union\r\n  - United States\r\n* Imminent: EU General Data Protection Regulation\r\n  - Scope\r\n  - Core Rights\r\n  - Examples\r\n* Future\r\n* Conclusion",

    "abstract": "Coroutines are the most exciting, fastest-changing feature developed in Python 3. Catch up on the latest: how native coroutines work, how to cancel a coroutine or give it a time limit, and how context variables give coroutines the equivalent of thread-local storage.",
    "description": "(5 minutes) Coroutine refresher. Show an asyncio coroutine example that uses \"async\" and \"await\". The example code launches a pair of coroutines to fetch two URLs concurrently. They print status messages as they make progress; you can see from the interleaved output that they run concurrently. Python coroutines behave much like Python threads, with several advantages: Python can launch many more coroutines at once than threads, coroutines are less prone to race condition bugs, and coroutines can be timed out or cancelled. Let's examine that third feature in detail.\r\n\r\n(12 minutes) Cancellation. One coroutine can cancel another. Update the example code so the URL fetcher that finishes first cancels the other. You can't do this with threads!\r\n\r\nWhen a coroutine is cancelled, a CancelledError is thrown from the root of the coroutine's call stack, down the call chain, and thrown at the \"await\" statement where the coroutine is currently paused. (Coroutines can prevent cancellation using the \"shield\" function, or with a try/except block. The audience should research these features if they're curious.)\r\n\r\nThe most common way to cancel a coroutine is a timeout. Update our example to use \"asyncio.wait_for\" with a timeout. The implementation of wait_for is quite legible; we'll look at the asyncio standard library code to see how it works.\r\n\r\n(13 minutes) Context variables. In a thread-based framework like Flask, thread local storage is often used to hold the \"context\" of the task the thread is working on. Starting in Python 3.7, coroutines can use \"context variables\" to accomplish the same purpose. Update our example to store each URL fetcher's context in a context variable.\r\n\r\nWhen a program launches concurrent coroutines, each inherits a copy of its parent's context. This is not how thread local storage works! Update the example to show how a child inherits its parent's context, but modifying the child's context does not affect the parent.\r\n\r\nModern coroutines in Python 3.7 have all the power of threads, especially now that they have context variables, and they have several features threads lack: they obey cancellation and timeouts, and they inherit context variables from their parents.\r\n\r\nNo Q \u0026 A during the time slot, but I'll invite audience members to come talk with me in the hallway afterward.",

    "description": "Generative models are models that learn the underlying structure of a dataset (e.g. Pokemon images) and can then produce new samples (new Pokemons) from the same distribution. These are distinct from discriminative models which are trained to distinguish between different classes.\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial, we will use pytorch to learn about generative adversarial networks (GANs), a recently developed class of generative models. In the GAN framework, two neural networks - the generator and the discriminator - are in an adversarial teaching (think Ph.D student/advisor) relationship which helps the generator learn the underlying structure of the data. In simple terms, the generator's goal is to come up with data that the discriminator cannot distinguish from data it is trained on. \r\n\r\nPyTorch is one of the leading deep learning frameworks and is probably the most pythonic way to build deep-learning models today. In this tutorial, we will use PyTorch to explore some common architectures to generate synthetic images for a street-fighter like game. \r\n\r\nI hope to leave the audience with two things - gain an appreciation for how deep learning can be used for generative models, and how PyTorch can let you use GANs to generate data for various projects. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Tentative Schedule (for a 60 minute tutorial)\r\n### Introduction to GANs (15 minutes)\r\nStart with a brief introduction to neural networks and then go on to describe the minimax game framework of GANs proposed by Goodfellow et al. \r\n\r\n### Brief overview of PyTorch (10 minutes + 10 minute hands-on)\r\nBriefly introduce the torch framework for building models and use hands-on time to build a simple discriminatory network/GAN. Depending on audience comfort with neural networks, this can be the famous MNIST digit classifier (a discriminatory network) or a GAN to generate digits. In either case, skeleton code would be provided. \r\n\r\n### Hands-on part building street fighter images. (15 minutes hands-on)\r\nUse provided skeleton code to generate synthetic street fighter images from existing characters. If training time is an issue, pre-trained models will be provided. \r\n\r\n### Discuss/Demo further applications of GANs (5 minutes + 5 minutes for Q\u0026A)\r\nGANs have been successful with other kinds of data (text to images, image captioning etc). Demo/discuss some of these applications and leave some time for questions. ",

I will provide a brief background, but 60 minutes is too short to delve into this vast field. My goal is to provide a flavour for what generative models (specifically GANs) can accomplish and how easy it is to build these models using established architectures (though, training them can be a different story). \r\n\r\nTechnically, this talk will not require too much apart from pytorch (and associated dependencies) installed on the user's systems. For training, there are a couple of ways for attendees to get free access to GPUs (Google Colab, Kaggle Kernels). Training the models maybe left out if time proves to be a constraint. \r\n\r\nMy background is in physics, but I have been fascinated by neural network models for a few years now. I am a founding member of a group in Toronto that tries to implement deep learning papers over the weekend. We have been delving deep into GANs which is where my excitement for them began. It is this excitement that I hope to share with the broader PyCon Canada community. ",

You may check out my [projects](https://github.com/shagunsodhani), [talks](http://shagunsodhani.in/talks/) and [resume](https://shagunsodhani.in/online-cv/).\r\n\r\nI love Computer Science in general and Machine Learning in particular. I regularly [read and summarise papers](https://shagunsodhani.in/papers-I-read/) from these domains. I am also interested in Maths and Economics. I always look forward to meeting interesting people and learn new stuff, both in-person and remotely. If you want to talk, feel free to [drop me a line](mailto:sshagunsodhani@gmail.com).",

    "description": "PyTorch is a deep learning framework for fast, flexible experimentation.  PyTorch is not a Python binding into some C++ framework. It is designed to have a first-class integration with Python. The framework is intuitive, linear in thought and easy to use. Unlike some other deep learning frameworks, PyTorch allows you to arbitrarily change the structure of your neural network on the fly with very small overhead. All these aspects make it an attractive choice for trying out new ideas in deep learning.\r\n\r\nContent:\r\n\r\n* Few slides about \"what is PyTorch\"\r\n* Few slides about \"what is Tensor\" and \"operations supported\" over tensor.\r\n    * These slides would not go into the internals and are presented to keep the presentation self-contained.\r\n* Minimal introduction to backpropagation\r\n    * Note that I am assuming that the audience is familiar with basic machine learning and backpropagation.\r\n* Few slides on torch neural network library\r\n* Building our first neural network\r\n    * Define the network\r\n    * Specifiy the loss function\r\n    * Do backprop (only from the perspective of the API)\r\n    * Update the weights\r\n* Given this neural network, we will preapre a data pipeline\r\n   * Loading data\r\n   * Preprocessing data\r\n   * Training the model\r\n   * Interpreting the results\r\n*How to train the same model on a GPU with minimal changes\r\n* How to use other numerical computation libraries with PyTorch\r\n* Conclusion\r\n\r\nI would be using a pdf for the presentation (when discussing things like \"what is PyTorch\").

    "abstract": "Are you teaching or learning Python? In order to make the most of the experience, we must move the learning through a hierarchy of objectives (Bloom’s Taxonomy). See how the Harry Potter series illustrates this learning hierarchy in the magical world, then apply that to teaching \u0026 learning Python.",
    "description": "Have you thought about teaching Python? Are you trying to learn Python? To be successful, it is critical that the learning experiences move you through a hierarchy of learning objectives (known in education as Bloom’s Taxonomy). This ensures that you can progress from simply recalling coding concepts to being able to develop your own original code. The hierarchy has six levels: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create. But what does Harry Potter have to do with the learning objectives and coding? Simple. Throughout the seven books \u0026 eight movies in the Harry Potter series, there are numerous examples demonstrating each of the learning objectives in the hierarchy. Remember, Harry is experiencing a steep learning curve. Harry must learn potions, charms, and transfiguration, all with tools he has never used before. Doesn’t that sound familiar? Instead of magic, you are learning the language of Python as well as learning to think like a programmer. Instead of a cauldron and wand, you are using a text editor and a debugger, maybe Python Tutor. In this presentation, I address the six levels in the hierarchy, describe the types of learning outcomes in each level using action verbs, provide a clear example from the Harry Potter series with video clips, and then relate it back to teaching and learning Python.",
    "notes": "Technical Requirements: I will be showing a presentation including links to video clips from the Harry Potter movies to serve as examples. Showing examples from of the learning objectives with clips from the movies allows participants to comfortably grasp the concepts before applying it to coding. Further, this makes the concepts more accessible.\r\n\r\nWhy am I qualified to deliver this presentation? I am a former Professor of Literacy Education with years of experience teaching teachers HOW to teach, and students HOW to learn.

This is how we evolved for the last two years with the creation of the first automation ecosystem at the UofT ITS Private Cloud, including a RESTful API, SDK, CLI  written in Python and a React based UI.",
    "description": "The growth in demand of virtual server instances at the University of Toronto ITS Private Cloud and the limited number of staff in the Hardware Infrastructure Group drove innovation to create the first ITS Private Cloud RESTful API with Asynchronous task and distributed processing which added our team's business logic to a VMware vSphere environment for self provisioning. \r\n\r\nIn the talk we will explore how we reduced turnaround times from days to minutes and from minutes to seconds by creating an ecosystem based mainly in Python OSS libraries including Flask, PyVMomi, Celery, Paramiko, Psycopg, etc and the benefits of running on a clustered environment of Docker Swarm Community Edition with Portworx as the cluster storage driver.  Also, we will talk about how we overcome the REST API adoption barrier by creating a cross-platform SDK and Command Line Interface with Click. Finally, why we decided to create the ITS Private Cloud Portal (UI) written in React, the challenges and the value added to the backing API.\r\n\r\nWe intend to demonstrate how the ecosystem can be deployed in minutes for new VMware vSphere installations, scaled up/down and provision a few virtual instances by either the API, SDK, CLI and UI.\r\n",
    "notes": "I designed, developed, documented and deployed the RESTful API, SDK and CLI from ground up, including the current production and testing environment thinking from the beginning in a containerized setup for resiliency, availability and scalability. I've given workshops, tutorials and written several how-to's for end users internally at UofT to familiarize with the different components:\r\n- https://eis.utoronto.ca/%7Evss/vsscli/ \r\n- https://eis.utoronto.ca/%7Evss/pyvss/\r\n- https://vss-wiki.eis.utoronto.ca/display/API\r\n\r\nThe author of the UI aka ITS Cloud Portal, Orlando Ramirez Martinez, will be joining me in the presentation (if approved). \r\n\r\nThanks.",

    "abstract": "Intake is a simple library providing one interface for cataloging, finding, describing and reading any data locally, in the cloud, or on an Intake server. Intake separates the definition of data sources from their analysis, so that Data Engineers and Data Scientists can get on with their jobs.",
    "description": "Defining and loading data-sets costs time and effort. The data scientist needs to know what data are available, and the characteristics of each data-set, before going to the effort of loading and beginning to analyze a specific data-set. Furthermore, they might need to learn the API of some Python package specific to the target format. The code to do such data loading often makes up the first block of every notebook or script, propagated by copy\u0026paste.\r\n\r\nIntake has been designed as a simple layer over other Python libraries to provide:\r\n\r\n- a consistent API, so that you can investigate and load all of your data with the same commands, without knowing the details of the backend library\r\n- a simple cataloging system using YAML syntax, enabling, for every data-set:\r\n  - a description of which plugin is to load it\r\n  - arguments to pass\r\n  - arbitrary metadata to associate with the data\r\n  - transparent access to remote catalogs and data, for most formats\r\n- a minimalist plugin system, so that new loaders, remote containers, and many other components can be contributed to Intake with a minimum of fuss.\r\n\r\nFor a simple design and relatively small code-base, there are lots of features. We will demonstrate the main ones and show typical work-flows from two points of view:\r\n\r\n- the end user (e.g., Data Scientist), who will be provided with an easy-to-use method for browsing data catalogs, getting basic descriptions of each entry. For each data-set, detailed metadata and data structure descriptions and quick-look plotting are available as one-liners, allowing for quick decisions on which data are appropriate for a given problem, and then Intake gets out of the way. The user need never know the details of the storage format of the data.\r\n\r\n- the catalog designer (e.g., Data Engineer), who wants to get on with deciding where data should be stored, in which format, and which package is best suited to load each data-set, so long as the data scientist, above, gets the data-frame (or other artefact) they need. Catalogs also provide a natural place to describe each data-set, with text and arbitrary metadata. Finally, catalogs can also encode user parameters, giving either natural choices to the end user (e.g., to filter a data set, or choose between version A and B), or for getting information required for data access from the user’s environment.\r\n\r\nThus, Intake provides a very simple yet useful division between the users of data, and the maintainers of data source catalogs. Intake has approachable code and is extensible in many places, and so hopefully can progress to become an all-inclusive data ecosystem for numerical Python.",

Often these results are not up to the mark. The image sometimes gets distorted, misaligned or blurred.\r\n\r\nDeviating from the standard mechanisms, I would like to talk about a technique called as **Content aware image resizing**.

Using this theory, we are going to present an alternative application of natural language processing. Specifically, we will show how to build an AI text generator capable to learn the writing style of most famous writers and even capable to create its own style. The talk is design to cover from most basic natural language processing concepts, main techniques for text preprocessing to finally apply the these concepts to design our first AI powered writer.\r\n\r\n\r\nOutline\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nNLP fundamentals\r\nData preprocessing\r\nBuilding an AI text generator\r\nExamples",
    "notes": "There are not technical requirements for the talk. It is just required beginner python experience and passion for Artificial Intelligence! Ivan has several years applying machine learning, statistical models and computational modelling in areas like finance, economics, physics (astrophysics, high energy physics) and cybersecurity. His latest research experience its centered around natural language processing applications for cybersecurity. Some of their recent talks have been at Anti Phishing Working group symposium (https://www.antiphishing.org/), DEFCON (https://www.defcon.org/) and Bogota Data Science meetup (https://www.meetup.com/es/Machine-Learning-Data-Science-Bogota/events/past/)",

A set of societal changes brought on by the potential for automation from machine learning tools that will dramatically, and relatively rapidly change the nature of work.

While it may not be as close as some would sell it, we are moving and we should be ready for it.\r\n\r\nWe're going to look at where we are in the process of achieving a soft singularity; where machine learning becomes a general tool to be applied to most programming tasks, and where the state of the art is sufficient to rewrite the economics of industries when it is applied. We'll look at a few ideas of what a soft singularity tool set would need to provide, and what that would let it do with regard to changing the nature of work.\r\n\r\nWe'll contrast our current accomplishments with the idea of what is necessary to bring about a soft singularity, then highlight the areas of research that seem to be pointing toward this type of goal, and what each capability would enable within this limited and controlled form of machine learning applications. We'll look at some of the issues surrounding access, fairness, ethics and the like.\r\n\r\nWe'll briefly contrast the ideas of soft and hard singularities and highlight the features of thought that we likely do not need to develop just to dramatically shift the nature of work, but which would shade into producing a general intelligence. We'll look at how those features might wind up being useful as tools applied to machine learning projects.\r\n\r\nFinally, we'll discuss the ethical and practical questions surrounding the drive to automate away significant fractions of the livelihoods of the masses of the world. This will necessarily include discussing whether these technologies will wind up exacerbating existing issues, biases and the like. Does the potential for increased productivity and freedom from drudgery justify potentially destabilising countries?

    "description": "This talk continues the “Simple Made Easy” framework theme from my talks at PyCon 2016 and 2017. What is described is a simple and robust method for Immutable Tuple Flux computing. Streams are the future! My 2016 talk \"Simple made easy\" has over 2,700 views. People are saying, \"OK, it sounds good. How do I get started with Data Stream Infrastructure?\" This talk will illustrate that the process is simple and easy! The subject application is non-trivial – a large scale Payroll application! \r\n\r\n“Citizen Developers” (who are not in short supply) can employ Python to create exactly the Microservices they need and want. This empowers the stakeholders, and eases many of the cultural problems that so often bring conflict in software development work. The Data Stream Infrastructure (DSI) process is inherently Agile, because it meets the original 12 Agile principles without using scrums, kanbans, standups, or micromanaging.\r\nWhat if all software could be reduced to the equation: \ty = F (Y,G) \r\nwhere: y is a new Immutable Tuple, F is a Microservice Function, Y is the set of all previously published Immutable Tuples, and G is fresh GUI input. The only system data persistence is Y. That would change how we do computing! \r\n\r\nSimple made easy. \r\n\r\nThis talk describes the Data Streaming application of DSI in more detail, showing its application to a major Government Payroll system. We were punching above our weight!\r\n\r\nThe blogosphere is full of caveats and warnings about Microservices, and how  they can turn into Megadisasters. Our DSI methodology is easy and safe to use, and it has a short learning curve. We think it is a \"software silver bullet\". It is accessible to \"Citizen Developers\". DSI is a \"medium code\" paradigm, because the Microservices are small single-person programs, and the developer does not need a CS degree! \r\n",

Yet our community often tends towards full-on Software Engineering as the \"proper\" way to code. I'll demonstrate that these styles can both be done with basic or advanced Python. After that, I'll look at practices that may benefit one, but not the other, discuss when there may be shifts between the two, and examine how we as existing community members can help guide new members down the path that best fits their goals. This maximizes their chance for success and our chance to add new contributors to our community. Let's not forget: Python is a FLOSS project.

    "description": "At Mozilla, open software and open collaboration has been central to our identity as an organization since the beginning, but in 20 years the nature of openness - the context, the challenges, and the costs - has changed dramatically.  The word \"open\" means a lot now, and implies a lot more, and it's working overtime in any discussion about software and the organizations that create it to paper over some deep disagreements and troubling trends in how we work, what we work on and why. \r\n\r\nI'd like to spend some time talking about how our ideas of openness have evolved for the people, communities and institutions that value, what that means, and what comes next.",
    "notes": "I have modest technical requirements for this - some static slides, I'm mostly a talker, but I like to walk around a lot.\r\n\r\nAs for \"why I'm the best person to speak on this subject\" , I may not be? I've been working at Mozilla for the last few years as we've struggled through dramatic cultural and engineering changes, and I flatter myself to think I've helped us succeed at those changes. I think there's some value in understanding how things have evolve, and I'd be effective at communicating that evolution.",

    "description": "Have you ever had a bug where an accented phrase such as \"N° de téléphone\" turns into \"NÂ° de tÃ©lÃ©phone\"? This is known as mojibake (文字化け), which is a Japanese term meaning roughly \"character change\". It's evidence of a bug in code that does (should do) character encoding, decoding, or possibly both.\r\n\r\nWeb protocols help, but they also add some complexities, make it easy to introduce defects, make it harder to debug them, and for some let them get by without really understanding what's going on with encoding.\r\n\r\nAfter this session you will know how to correctly use Unicode and its character encodings to write correct code, and how to diagnose encoding defects.\r\n\r\nWe'll cover the Unicode standard and relevant aspects of UTF-8, ASCII, ISO-8859-1, UTF-16, Windows-1252, and the Byte Order Mark (BOM) character. Several examples will be presented to demonstrate how encoding can go wrong and how to diagnose the problems.",

    "description": "In software we deal with a lot of uncertainties. This can include technology choices, vendors, deadlines, team structure and sustainability just to name a few. But instead of embracing uncertainty and taking on the risk of delivering something, we rather try to manage and mitigate the risk by not putting software in front of real users at all. Does this sound counter productive to you? It sure does to me.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we’ll discuss ways to deal with those risks. Almost always there’s a way to gather feedback quicker than waiting until the “perfect” solution is ready. “Done is better than perfect” they say. We’ll go through examples of how to slice user stories in ways that benefit our users as well as our teams.\r\nWe will learn techniques that help us slicing big and risky features into smaller, manageable and useable features. This not only helps us developers mitigate risks, it also helps management deal with delivery pressures in a different and more open way.",
    "notes": "Building trust goes both ways by incrementally building software. We build trust with our fellow developers by constantly building something that works and we build trust with our surrounding management because we constantly deliver something valuable.\r\n\r\nIn many of my past projects I've been part of at 8th Light, I've seen teams and organisations struggle with the idea of releasing something that's not super polished. It doesn't have to be this way, though. Almost always there's a way to carve out something small and manageable out of a huge task. This talk is exactly about that. Amongst other things we'll go through examples of stories we've worked on, how they were tackled and how successful the implementation was.

Furthermore, the deployment of the bridge for a given client required a special tool, the deployer, used to copy only the specific required parts of the bridge into the client system.\r\n\r\nTo solve those problems, we split the bridge into an ecosystem of small interrelated packages. Each package now has its own version number and dependencies along both the bridge itself and third-party Python libraries. This allows to upgrade a single client package without affecting the whole bridge product. It also eases the installation because the client's package knows what are the required packages to install.\r\n\r\nOn the technical side, first part of the solution was to use namespace package. This little-known feature of Python allows many related packages to be imported from the same base package name. There are three ways of declaring namespace packages:\r\n1. Implicit Namespace Packages, available since Python 3.3, and described in PEP 420;\r\n2. Using `pkgutil.extend_path`;\r\n3. Using `setuptools.declare_namespace`.\r\nWhile PEP 420 namespace package is the modern way to go, we used `pkgutil` namespace because we still need to support Python 2. Hopefully, the transition to PEP 420 should be easy once we will be able to drop Python 2. While not mandatory, the namespace package allows to:\r\n1. Split a big package into smaller packages that can optionally be installed or not;\r\n2. Explicitly show the strong relation between our micropackages;\r\n3. Easily detect plugins into installed packages.\r\nThe first part of my presentation will be about namespace packages, why and how to use them.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the solution concerns `setuptools`. Nothing special is required in `setuptools` to use namespace package and declare dependencies between the packages. However, using a special `setup.py` file at the root of the project allows to manage the set of micropackages as a single library for easier integration with CI tools. In the second part of my presentation I will show you how I hacked `setuptools` to build and install all the micropackages in a single command.\r\n\r\nFinally, I will conclude showing you how our new package structure eases the maintainability and the deployment of our solution.\r\n",

    "title": "Managing OpenAPI technical writing workflows with oaspec and oawriter",
    "abstract": "Many tools exist for developing and testing APIs based on the OpenAPI standard, but there is limited tooling for documenting existing APIs. oaspec fills this need by providing a mutable representation of OAS in Python, and oawriter enhances the workflow for writing human-readable API docs.",
    "description": "Although there is a large ecosystem of tools for designing, developing, and testing APIs based on the OpenAPI Specification (OAS; formerly known as Swagger), the available tooling for documenting existing RESTful APIs is relatively limited.\r\n\r\nOpenAPI specification generators rely on complex annotations written in a domain-specific language and require user-facing narrative documentation to be stored in code. In contrast, manually-maintained specification documents are written directly as OAS definitions and keep code separate from narrative docs, but can quickly become out of date. These issues are compounded when an organization provides access to multiple backend microservices through an API gateway which must provide a single API definition.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this talk is to introduce and demonstrate `oaspec` and `oawriter`—two open source tools which aim to solve these problems.\r\n\r\n`oaspec` is an unopinionated Python package for creating and manipulating OAS definitions in Python. With it, developers can generate machine-readable API definitions without needing redundant annotations, and they can build unified gateway specifications from multiple backend service definitions.\r\n\r\n`oawriter` is a CLI tool (built on `oaspec`) for managing the technical writing workflow of user-facing API docs. It allows a technical writer to write, organize, and update independent narrative docs, inject them into machine-readable definitions, and create API documentation consumable by OAS tools and end users alike.\r\n\r\nThe tools that I will be introducing in this talk were built to fill the need for full-featured, flexible documentation tools that can work with existing APIs. They are being used in production to support a complex API serving multiple backend services.",
    "notes": "I am a technical writer and Python cloud engineer at Platform.sh, a container-based Platform-as-a-Service providing NoOps/serverless application hosting.\r\n\r\nWhen I was hired this past summer, my first task was documenting our existing APIs and generating a unified API specification to be served by our new API gateway. After a thorough review of existing tools, I found that many were so opinionated that using them would require us to rewrite parts of our backend, and none of them offered a flexible way to combine specs from multiple backend services. These tools are the result of filling that need. This material has not been presented anywhere else.\r\n\r\nNote that I haven't included any links to the project because we have not yet released the tools as of the time of writing. This is because the original tool (that we're currently using in production) is both an importable package and CLI tool for working with Swagger/OAS 2.0 definitions, and it was fairly tailored to our specific use case. We've decided to move our API to OAS 3.0, and since the tooling has to be modified to accommodate that, I'm extracting the OAS model into a separate package as `oaspec` and broadening the scope of both tools to a general use case.\r\n\r\nAs I'm developing it for public release, I'm making sure it has total test coverage and thorough documentation, and I want it to have a mostly complete feature set before release which will take another week or two. If you're reviewing this more than two weeks after the submission deadline, the package is likely residing at: https://github.com/platformsh/oaspec",

    "abstract": "Deploying and configuring Tensorflow/MXNet on virtual instances is non-trivial. Could we train a model on the by just pressing a \"bottom\"? Serverless cloud does.  Serverless architectures like AWS Lambda are going to be the next-gen cloud. We've crafted a ML framework running on AWS Lambda.",
    "description": "Existing distributed machine learning (ML) frameworks heavily rely upon the parallelism achieved using a dedicated cluster of physical servers or virtualized instances, and one needs to know the quantity and type of these servers to employ for each machine learning training job. Yet, for ML practitioners and data scientists, the process of provisioning a physical or virtualized computing platform itself is inevitably lengthy and error-prone. For example, it is challenging to choose the optimal configuration from numerous combinations of instance types and settings on AWS EC2, which has 115 instance types. \r\n\r\nFollowing the footsteps of traditional virtual machines and Docker containers, _serverless_ (or Function-as-a-Service) architectures, represented by AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions, have emerged as a burgeoning cloud computation model to further reduce costs and improve manageability in cloud computing.  With serverless architectures, developers do not need to manage dedicated servers for their applications. Instead, they only need to define a set of stateless functions with access to a common data store. Due to its lightweight nature, ease of management, and ability to rapidly scale up, serverless computation has become the trend of building next-generation web services and applications.\r\n\r\nMost existing machine learning frameworks are designed for physical servers or virtual instances, such as TensorFlow, MXNet and PyTorch. For machine learning developers without a dedicated cluster, they deploy their machine learning dev stack on cloud such as AWS EC2. However,  the cloud is usually not fully utilized due to the trial-and-error nature of machine learning jobs. For example, the model hyper-parameters is adjusted frequently, then the training is paused and the cluster is idle but billed. Therefore, training a model with serverless architectures is appealing because 1) developers only pay for the computing time; and 2) thousands concurrent functions can be revoked simultaneously to provide high computing parallelism. \r\n\r\nWe have developed a prototype of framework that performs asynchronous ML training on serverless architectures. This talk will show how to train a CNN model with the AWS Lambda and give a brief introduction about the APIs of the prototype.",

    "description": "We still live in an era where most of the computer behavior is dictated by human generated code. \r\n\r\nOne of biggest errors one can make is to assume that such code is bullet proof based of the “false positives” facts that people take for granted: “works on my machine”, “it has 100% test coverage”, and such.\r\n\r\nThe impact of such assumption is the unawareness of unexpected behaviour, which, to some extend, should be already covered by current testing methodologies, considering that code already doesn’t work 100% of the time.\r\n\r\nThe talk approaches the overwhelming challenges of writing reliable code professionally: How does one ensure the code works the way it was designed to?\r\n\r\nExploring the bottlenecks of the traditional approach, comparing with modern practices and analysing the impact both from engineering and product perspective.\r\n",

This talk will describe the real experience based on years of the serverless application development.",
    "description": "The idea of adopting multiple programming languages to build highly distributed applications is not new to anyone. We all been taught to use necessary toolkits to solve certain problems in the most efficient way. 12Factor concept helped us to understand how to shift from the monolithic applications to smaller functional units - microservices, with that we can extract the most critical pieces of code into a microservice that can be made natively fault-tolerant. But where is the limit to the number of microservices within one application, when the application becomes sort of the nightmare to those who maintain those?\r\n\r\nThe serverless concept (namely serverless architecture pattern) is the next MUST technology to adopt for the application development. With the serverless developers can stop worrying about the number of components necessary to have up and running for the sake of the stability and fault-tolerance.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'd like to show how a new serverless offering - The Fn Project, empowers developers to pick exact, the most efficient, open source technologies to solve their business needs. This talk will describe the real experience based on years of the serverless application development. \r\n\r\nAs the result you might get the following takeaways:\r\n\r\n* serverless is not something you should be afraid of\r\n* how to develop the microservices using serverless architecture pattern\r\n* the upsides and the downsides of the serverless\r\n",
    "notes": "Well, why am I the best one to speak on the subject? I have pretty good experience in serverless, open source and decision-making areas. I'd like to share real experience of \"making serverless\" as well as the transition from microservices to the scalable serverless solutions. And it's not a total product pitch, we're talking about the real open source project here, not a marketing bullshit.\r\n",

    "abstract": "By using Django and gRPC we can increase web application security at the cost of complexity and performance.  How much more complex does our web application become?  And how much performance do we lose?  Is it worth it?",
    "description": "Traditional web application architectures often have direct access to a production database via credentials stored as environment variables.  This enables queries constructed within the web application to be executed against a remote database server.  In the event of a security vulnerability that introduces remote code execution, such as Apache Struts CVE-2017-5638, it also allows attackers full access to the production database.  Through introducing a distributed service oriented architecture we can reduce our exposure to security vulnerabilities that expose remote code execution at the expense of performance and complexity.  This talk will analyze one such implementation with Django and gRPC and assess the additional complexity and performance characteristics of the distributed architecture compared to that of a traditional web application setup.\r\n\r\nIn addition to covering the aforementioned abstract we'll address what RCE vulnerabilities are, what is gRPC and how it's possible decouple data access via gRPC, at what size and type of project does a distributed architecture of this nature make sense, what operational changes need to be made to your development and deployment processes, what alternatives exist to gRPC, and where to go for more information.",

    "description": "Don’t you just hate it when you are applying for a job, after a long series of technical test we still have to have the HR round of discussion?  Why are we obsessed with talking and interviewing people when everything today is just a tap of a screen away?\r\n\r\nIn the age of the early man, the resources were very limited and the animals wanting to eat you alive, very large. To keep themselves safe and increase their tribe, they read the person’s face and through that the sentiments, all to gather if they could trust that person and make him/her a part of them.\r\n\r\n Trust and belief in the person was all that was needed, and all figured out through basic communication. \r\n\r\nSo why aren’t interviews solving this in today's age?\r\n\r\nInterviews are great, but they have some inherent flaws:\r\n\r\n1.Time-taking\r\n2.Prone to human bias\r\n3.Not always gives the right result\r\n\r\nWe are at an age where we have sophisticated technical rounds, there’s an entire community on lets say, Kaggle that can validate the extent of our tech skills, so why not build something that can also being interviews at par with the technical tests. Let’s build a tool that retains the essence of building trust through conversation but gives an objective result like Kaggle.\r\n\r\nLet’s call in the super heroes, Python and Alexa (more like Batman \u0026 Robin)\r\n\r\nThe agenda of this tutorial is to enable people to marry the voice processing capabilities of Alexa, AWS Components and the agility of Python to enable Machine Learning to build something that you could talk to, and on the fly.\r\n\r\nImagine getting a job coz you had a chat with a bot, imagine how the barriers of accents, languages and perceptions can be removed, imagine how this can be scaled to any application with a human touch. It’s this endless imagination of the people and how it can ease their lives is what drives us to spread our message and get the world to build something beyond imagination.\r\n\r\n",

Professionally, In my current role at Aditya Birla Group, a multi-billion dollar conglomerate, I research the organization’s challenges (specifically financial services), the emerging tech environment and enable solutions that are people centric and enable employees to be more productive and happy.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I am a pythonista who has been in love with the enabling power of python since I was in college, a computer science graduate at SRM University, Chennai. As I was building my hands-on capabilities in python, my passion for psychology and human systems took me to complete my MBA in HR from NMIMS, Mumbai bringing me into a field that is people centric and more human. The mix of Computer Science and HR helps me bring in the empathy and impact of the use case and also enables me to help people with a more hands-on way of developing a solution. \r\n\r\nSome of the projects that I have worked in the past / currently working upon :\r\n\r\n•Gamifying the hiring process over Virtual Reality for sales roles\r\n•Using Augmented Reality to train new employees \r\n•Building models to predict attrition and hiring fit\r\n\r\nI feel I would learn more in the process discussing with the inquisitive minds and the endless possibilities people from different perspective bring in. Thus I feel it’s an opportunity that would help me and hopefully the participants to be in a better space of knowledge and skills.\r\n\r\n",

It never appealed to me, and I refused to learn for years.\r\n\r\nThen one day, my brother and I were chatting on Slack and he showed me his new chatbot experiment - and it could send a gif! I wanted it to send more gifs, but my brother refused to add more. “Here is the GitHub repo, figure out how to change it yourself if you want more gifs.” “But this is python.” “Google it, I’m busy.” And with that, my journey began.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that code had a lot of interest to me, I had just been being taught the kind of coding that my teachers enjoyed, rather than teaching me tools for my interests. I learned how to re-write the gif if/else loop, then how to solve a problem that kept crashing my excel, then how to call an API to see what knitting patterns were trending, then how to store that data in an SQL database so I could look at it again later. All of a sudden, I realized that I was coding more than I was using any other tools.\r\n\r\nThis talk, while nominally about my personal journey to learn python, is about applying some of the philosophies of learner-centered education in teaching new coders, through focusing on the student's learning style and other interests. The target audience for this talk would be coders who want to teach others, and I would hope from this talk that they come away with some ideas for teaching python to the wider community.\r\n\r\nI have not presented this material elsewhere.",

The conventional way of literature review using human readers is no longer viable when there is a ‘big data’ explosion of academic publications in climate change research alone. In this talk, we present an efficient method of systematic literature review using data science technique to automatically ‘select’ relevant publications minimizing the tasks for human readers. Here we use a combination of machine learning (Scikit-Learn) and bibliometric \u0026 citation network libraries [Networks-Lab/Metaknowledge](http://networkslab.org/metaknowledge/) to search for publications related to the IPCCs new scenario framework and classify each article into topical categories.

    "description": "Artificial Intelligence is taking the world by storm, fueled largely by the introduction of the elastic compute resources in public cloud. If you’ve recently shopped online, searched the web, or streamed a video, you’ve almost certainly interacted with systems powered by AI. These systems are built on powerful Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, that until recently, required large time and financial commitments, as well as specialized knowledge and experience to properly develop, train and test. This is not so any more – the power of cloud computing has brought ML to the masses. Every developer now has the ability to leverage powerful ML resources of the cloud and bring the benefits of AI to their customers and users.\r\n\r\nBut … where do you start? What services can you use? What services should you use? How do you integrate those services into you application?\r\n\r\nDuring this session we’ll answer those questions, and more, while building and evolving an AI-enabled application. We’ll review ML, introducing common concepts, terms and language. Then, we’ll look at what ML services are provided by cloud vendors like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, and talk about which of those services is the right match for your application and for your team \u0026 skill set. Finally, we’ll walk through a real-world design and demo the resulting application. You’ll walk away from this session with the confidence and knowledge necessary to make the right choices for your own application.\r\n\r\nYou don’t have to be an AI/ML expert to attend this session, nor do you need AWS/GCP/Azure experience. We’ll keep that at a fairly high level.

Human ability to read or analyze is not capable of processing these large amounts of information. If we can identify the structure and consequently extract it to a user who needs a part of the structure, particularly an article in a foreign language, time will be saved as result. Computational approaches like Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) have been widely used for similar purposes. However, it is very important to identify which one, or which group of classifiers work better for a specific kind of problem. The objective of my work is to identify the best way to classify sentences from abstract papers into the IMRaD structure. This work demonstrates the possibility of integrating ML and NLP for the articles' sentence classification based on the IMRaD structure. ",

    "abstract": "Having been in love with APIs for pretty long now, I believe they are very significant in their import. In this talk, not only do I aim to show the simplicity of using Python for gleaning big data from sources, but also the best practices that can lead to building sound APIs of our own.",
    "description": "# Overview\r\nI begin with explaining the importance of using APIs today and the varied applications they support. APIs are empowering most of the world's applications today and are a seamless way of data communication. Furthermore, I talk about how some of the more popular APIs can be used to garner big data and how to get over the API hit limits that most of these APIs impose on users. Data gleaned from APIs happens to be a major part of the research projects around the world, and can potentially power applications in various ways. I prove the same with a live example of one of my projects which takes a rather unique approach to use this data in a business solution. Finally, I take it up a notch by showing how we can make our own (SECURE) APIs in Python through which we can work with front-end frameworks like React and Angular. Also, I talk about how deploying these APIs on a cloud can be done rather easily.",
    "notes": "The technical requirements are very minimalistic when it comes to building secure APIs in Python. The attendees may need a basic level of Python scholarship. The rest, I can take it from there. Coming to why I am the best person to speak on this subject, I am someone who has been working with APIs and using them in ETL pipelines for years now. I can very well tell the difference between a secure and an insecure API. Also, once I am done with my speech, the attendees will be able to create secure and flexible APIs within minutes. I think the best code is the code you do not need to write, and I believe Python endorses this point of view. However, understanding what happens in the background is even more important because procuring partial knowledge about a subject I believe, is worse than having no knowledge of it. Hence, I choose to take the security aspects of the APIs seriously in this speech and try to disseminate the valued information that I have gleaned from varied sources.",

    "title": "Formal Methods - Not Scary and Actually Useful!",
    "abstract": "Formal methods aren’t just for academia, they can be used in real systems too! In industry they can help you catch bugs earlier, increase quality, expand understanding, and deliver faster.\n\nI’ll describe 3 different formal methods: Parnas tables, and the model checkers Alloy and TLA+",
    "description": "When designing software, developers often don’t create more than rough pseudo-code and a few Visio diagrams, before starting work and hoping that any design bugs will be discovered before anything goes to production. Even in the case of highly complex, concurrent, fault-tolerant systems, we’re often hesitant to put much effort into thinking about our solution before firing up our favourite editor/IDE. \r\n\r\nBut what if you could eliminate bugs in your systems *before* you've written a single line of Python?\r\n\r\nFormal methods are a way to apply rigour to the design phase of your software. They offer a precise way to think about the problem you’re solving, and to explore possible solutions before you write any code. Some formal methods even let you run automated, exhaustive tests against the designs themselves. This lets you ensure that in the hundreds of millions of possible states your system might enter, you won’t hit some undesirable corner case.\r\n\r\nI’ve been applying formal methods at work for a few years now, using three different techniques.\r\n\r\nThe easiest to learn are called “Decision Tables”, or “Parnas Tables”. They provide a quick way to precisely document and think about branching and conditional logic. Do you have a function with some nasty but necessary embedded conditionals/branches, and you want to make sure it all makes sense? Then decision tables might be right for you!\r\n\r\nAlloy and TLA+ are two powerful systems, coming broadly from the world of “model checkers”. They allow you to specify the design of your system in a high-level language. The first effect of this is that it makes your system easier to discuss and reason about. Second, both Alloy and TLA+ allow you to automatically test that your system will never violate some properties you declare, before you even have code for your system.\r\n\r\nAlloy has been used to find security flaws in real systems and real protocols. Developers at AWS and Azure have used TLA+ to help design systems and find serious, highly-subtle bugs in products including S3, EC2, DynamoDB, Cosmos DB, Azure’s Service Fabric, Azure Networking, etc.\r\n\r\nThis talk will give a brief introduction to Decision Tables, Alloy, and TLA+",
    "notes": "I’ve been using formal methods in one form or another for almost two decades, with a particular focus on model checkers the past 1.5 years. I’ve successfully applied them at Rackspace, on multiple projects. I have a Software Engineering Ph.D. from a school that had a particular focus on formal methods.\r\n\r\nI’m an experienced public speaker, and comfortable in front of an audience.\r\n\r\nI’ve given versions of this talk multiple times, usually to positive feedback.\r\n\r\nI've spoken at the two previous PyCon Canadas:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lI3ipk6j3-k\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAEXHua4MQQ\r\n\r\nMy 2017 talk covers TLA+, which is 1/3 of the material for this year's talk. But I'll have a completely different TLA+ example this year. \r\n\r\nIf my talk is accepted, I'd prefer it to be scheduled on the Sunday, as it's unlikely I'll be able to attend on Saturday. ",

    "description": "Anyone who has ever had to deal with loads of unstructured data, be it corporate/govt. documents, invoices, forms etc to extract relevant information knows how tedious, mundane \u0026 frustrating it can be and have wished if only there was a quicker way to do all of this.\r\n\r\nContracts are one such form of unstructured data and extracting key relevant information from it can be difficult to an untrained eye. It may even take some good 20 minutes for a lawyer to go through a contract thoroughly and god forbids if one has to process hundred's of such documents. We tried to solve this problem by building custom sequence extraction models for legal contracts that analyse a contract and extract more than 22 key pieces of information, under a minute.\r\n\r\nThrough this talk, I hope to shed light on how a custom sequence detection model can be built to extract relevant information from a legal document and will go into depth of the following points:\r\n\r\n 1. Unique nature of legal contracts and legal lingo. What various steps were taken to tackle the problem and thus steps taken in preparation of the training data (kinds of feature engineering done).\r\n 2.  Description and comparison with various methods used (sliding-window + SVM, sliding-window + LR etc.) and how and why deep learning (bilstm+crf) gave the best results.\r\n 3. How the model can be generalised for other use cases.\r\n\r\nAttend this talk to learn how we built a custom sequence extractor which extracts entities of vastly varying length with more than 90% accuracy.",

Where does it occur? (except legal contracts)\r\n2. Why is it difficult?\r\n3. How to solve the problem?\r\n\r\nThus it'll be a talk which an average attendee at Pycon will be able to enjoy.\r\n\r\nI recently gave a talk at Pydata Delhi and have worked and deployed the sequence extraction model into production from ground up at my workplace.\r\nFor any queries or doubts, please contact me at sharmabhanu546@gmail.com, i'll be happy to answer and improve upon my proposal if needed.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n",

    "description": "Tests in the Linux kernel are sometimes limited. While there may be text files containing commands for a developer to run before submitting a patch, in many cases automation may be limited to a shell script to handle testing.  Enter tdc, an automation tool developed using Python.  Originally planned as an implementation of unittest, tdc instead evolved into a more flexible utility that could be used by anyone without any prior knowledge of Python.  It was implemented to test Linux Traffic Control (tc) using tc's command line interface.\r\n\r\nDevelopment wasn't easy, however - certain challenges were encountered along the way and these will be discussed during the talk, as will the successes and surprises that came from tdc's use.\r\n\r\nWhile the talk will be mostly about the development of tdc, its primary goal is to encourage more Python developers to get involved in contributing to the Linux kernel, whether it's through an existing tool like tdc, or developing something new to improve an existing process.  The talk will also briefly cover the process of submitting patches to the kernel if anyone is inspired to do so.",

    "description": "Traditional data science notebook environments, such as Jupyter, rely on server-side kernels to perform computation, which add additional complexity, latency and cost.  Pyodide helps to move the computation to the client, providing a familiar no-install experience without requiring specialized server-side resources.  Pyodide is built by compiling CPython and the major scientific packages (Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, etc.) to WebAssembly.  The result, since it is directly based on upstream packages, is fully-featured and familiar to Python data scientists.  Compute performance is between 1x-5x slower than native, depending on the application.  Interactive latency is significantly improved, since computation and visualization happen locally.  A powerful system to communicate between Python and the Javascript Web APIs is also included, making Python a fully-featured, yet somewhat heavyweight, client-side web development environment.

    "abstract": "Web applications and services require  efficient scaling for serving a large number of requests.In order to check the behavior of services under load we need to perform load and stress testing.This is done by generating requests similar to those made by users and test them in production environment.",
    "description": "There are several tools that assist with building, conducting and analyzing load tests for web apps. One of them is Locust.\r\nLocust.io is an open source Python-based user load testing tool. This lightweight, distributed and scalable framework helps to figure out how many simultaneous users a system can handle by writing test scenarios in Python code. It can be used for web applications, websites and web-based services.\r\nIn this talk you will learn how to define user behaviour with Python code, and swarm your system with millions of simultaneous users. Hopefully, at the end of this talk you will be able to build more efficient, robust and scalable python web apps.",

This way, an application can retrieve user-related data and showcase protected information to only logged in users.\r\n\r\n### Goals : \r\n\r\n* Promote and Educate people about authentication \u0026 authorization. \r\n* Learn about the different concepts of modern web apps. \r\n* Setup the environment \u0026 conclusion. \r\n\r\nIn the talk, we will learn how to use Auth0 to enable authenticated-only sections within a web application, as well as to retrieve protected resources and audiences have lots of opportunities to ask questions both technical and non-technical.",

Scaling, Robustness and reliability are few metrics that one has to take care of while doing so.\r\n\r\nThis talk will look into answering that question by taking the audience through an example using best made industry practices.\r\n\r\n**Tensorflow serving** \"is a flexible, high-performance serving system for machine learning models, designed for production environments\" . It allows one to deploy newer versions of a model to production without changing either the architecture or the API. \r\nConfigure automatic deployment of a newer model as soon as an update model is available and run it alongside the older one for a no frills transition or scrap the older model completely and run the improved one in the production. With Tensorflow Serving one can easily deploy, manage their models in production to scale and even automate their deployment pipeline.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n![Tensorflow Serving Architecture][1]  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n**Kubernetes** is used to deploy the created Serving, which will enable better scaling and robustness. How properties of a Kubernetes cluster like elasticity and resource management can be used to serve models to a large number of users and run computationally and data intensive models in production.\r\n\r\nAudience will be taken through each step of the process with in depth insights on the tools used while answering the questions of What, Why and How along the process.\r\n\r\n \r\n**Outline/structure of the Session**  \r\n\r\n - Build an example Machine Learning model.\r\n - Tensorflow Serving: learning to serve predictions at scale and manage various models in production.\r\n - Containerising the app.\r\n - Introduction to Kubernetes and how created models can be deployed through it for robustness and scalability.\r\n\r\n**Learning Outcome**\r\n\r\n- Learning about Tensorflow Serving and how it's architecture can help in management and serving of models at scale. (Used by Google themself in production)\r\n\r\n- Learn how to deploy trained models from Tensorflow Serving to Kubernetes for scalability and robustness.\r\n\r\nThe audience will be taken through an easy to follow example during the talk and by the end of the talk will know about the best practices of deployment in field of Machine learning and how to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.tensorflow.org/serving/images/serving_architecture.svg",

What was the exact problem we were trying to solve?\r\n2. What options did we try before this one?\r\n3. Why did they fail and what makes this solution better?\r\n4. What are the limitations of this solution?\r\n\r\nI recently gave this talk at Pydata Delhi and it was well received there, it'd be my pleasure to present it at Pycon Canada too.\r\n\r\nThank you.",

This experiment generated so much data that my only hope to analyze it was to write a program. After writing this program 5 years ago, I was hooked and began writing programs to source, clean, analyze and visualize data. Although I have written in many languages over the years, Python is by far my favourite because of its versatility, simplicity and community. To contribute back to this community I frequently volunteer as a coding mentor for Intro to Python workshops with Ladies Learning Code in Toronto.

This is how I built a robust data pipeline that funnels data into the training procedure of an image segmentation AI.",
    "description": "After completing a few small tasks at my job as a Data Engineer I had been given my first project of building the data infrastructure to collect and process all the imaging data to train a Convolutional Neural Net (CNN). I was familiar with the vast online content that intricately details methods used to build and optimize sophisticated machine learning models. However, I found that the online resources concerning themselves with the infrastructure supporting these models was lacking. My first attempt at building this infrastructure utilized the Hadoop ecosystem. However, I found myself equal parts confused and frustrated after four weeks of development and decided to go back to the drawing board. My second approach utilized a combination of Python and Postgres, making use of the task management package Luigi developed at Spotify. This approach allowed me to quickly setup the development environment and write complex processing procedures. I even extended the Luigi package to fit my own use cases. I found that building this infrastructure in Python was more enjoyable to write, easier to maintain and actually faster than Hadoop. I would like to share this experience of navigating the world of data engineering to build robust data pipelines that can support artificial intelligence.",

With this experience I have gained the practical knowledge of how to build scalable, maintainable and robust data infrastructure. I am extremely passionate about building these data systems and I want to share my most recent experience at PyCon Canada 2018 of building my most sophisticated data pipeline yet. I want to share the lessons I've learned in this project so that fellow developers can avoid some of my mistakes. I would like to give a powerpoint presentation outlining my journey of building a data pipeline used to train a CNN.

    "description": "\u003e ***It is always essential to understand the genesis of evolution or the roots of revolution.***\r\n\r\nKeeping in mind the above saying, I will provide a ***hands-on understanding*** of Blockchain technology using Python. There are multiple resources to get a firm understanding about this domain, but the best way to understand it is by using the concept of  **\"Learning-By-Doing\"**.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n**Following are few reasons why I want to willingly contribute to this domain:**\r\n\r\n - Blockchain is the underlying technology behind most of the\r\n   cryptocurrencies and it has a potential of changing the way we work\r\n   and communicate, making it more secure, efficient, and trustworthy.\r\n\r\n - There is a immense amount of speculation going around in this domain\r\n   with the rise of Bitcoin.  What’s happening with blockchain\r\n   technology, I would say, is similar to the great American gold rush\r\n   that happened in the mid 1800s.\r\n\r\n - Innovators, investors, entrepreneurs, technologists all are hovering\r\n   over the same underlying idea on how these cryptocurrencies work and\r\n   how could blockchain be leveraged to create use-cases beyond\r\n   crypto-systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, I would love to mention **few quotes to support the escalating phenomenon of Blockchain**:\r\n\r\n\u003e **The blockchain cannot be described just as a revolution.  It is a tsunami-like phenomenon, slowly advancing and gradually enveloping\r\n\u003e everything along its way by the force of its progression.** -- William\r\n\u003e Mougayar\r\n\r\n\u003e **Over the next decade, there will be disruption as significant as the Internet was for publishing, where blockchain is going to disrupt\r\n\u003e dozens of industries, one being capital markets and Wall Street.**\r\n\u003e -- Patrick M. Byrne\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nI will help people in understanding the bits and bytes of this domain, including the basic cryptography concepts, algorithms and how to utilize the power of Python language to build their own blockchain. As we progress, we would engage into more advanced concepts pertaining to scalability and deployment.\r\n\r\nUsing **on-the-go learning**  while developing will serve as a pivotal entry point for all the people who are willing to enter into this space and planning to  build smart-contracts or invest in cryptocurrencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n**Agenda**:\r\n\r\n - Introduction to Blockchain:  Existing problems, what is Blockchain, why it matters, gist of few use-cases, related concepts.\r\n - Blockchain under the hood: Cryptography 101, underlying data structure and algorithms, conceptual terminologies.\r\n - Python and Blockchain amalgamated: Create blockchain using python.\r\n - Discussion regarding scalability methods and resources.\r\n - Q\u0026A session.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Note: The above agenda is subject to change. It is tentative for now. Any changes will be updated here itself.**",

    "description": "## In this talk, I am going to talk about advanced concepts of Python related to Caching.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nA cache can be easily understood as **a saved answer to a question.** Caching can speed up an application if a computationally complex question is asked frequently. Instead of the computing the answer over and over, we can use the previously cached answer.\r\n\r\nCaching is an important component while scaling applications which are to be used by many users. It solves various problems related to cost and latency. Usually it takes more time to retrieve data from DB rather than cache. Using a cache to avoid recomputing data or accessing a slow database provides us with a great performance boost.\r\n\r\nI will describe in depth the different methods of Caching, their pros and cons. This talk will help developers focus on their code before scaling their applications. It will provide immense performance improvements with this simple concept.\r\n\r\n**Outcomes:** The novice audience will be able to understand basic Caching Mechanisms. They will be able to utiilize their knowledge which will serve pivotal while scaling applications\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n**Contents to be covered in talk:**\r\n\r\n 1. Local Caching: What is it, how to do it, example, built-in Python libraries: (using *cachetools*), advantages, dis-advantages  \r\n\r\n 2. Memoization: What is it, pseudo-code algorithm, implementation using example, built-in Python libraries: (using *lru_cache*), advantages, dis-advantages  \r\n\r\n 3. Distributed Caching: What is it, techniques: (using *memcached*, using *pymemcache*)\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n**Agenda:**\r\n\r\n - Initial 10 minutes: Introduction to Caching and its various techniques.  \r\n - 10 - 20 minutes: Examples and code walk through for various techniques.\r\n - 20 - 25 minutes: Comparative analysis of how caching is better than non-scaled applications.\r\n - 25 - 30 minutes: Q\u0026A session",

Unfortunately, meditation seems mystical from the outside. We’ll get to the core of what it really is and how anyone can reap the benefits of meditation.",
    "description": "Developers spend a ton of time worrying about system performance or application architecture, but how much time do we spend on ourselves? Modern languages like Python have had a significant effect on developer happiness which leads to massive productivity and meditation can take that even further. Learn how you can take a few moments for yourself to become a better developer, mentor, and community member.",
    "notes": "This talk is a soft talk without any actual code and will apply to everyone. I plan on having the entire group go through a single minute of silent meditation, without any guidance because that’s what people think of when they think meditation without digging any deeper. From there we’ll break down what meditation is, and show the incredible benefits that it can have on a person’s health and productivity. Along the way, I intend to reference studies on meditation and use my own experiences to help make the benefits more tangible. My hope is that the by the end of the talk, I’ve demystified meditation and that my call to action will prompt everyone to take a few moments for themselves to gain more focus and control in their lives.\r\n\r\nI have a bit of an obsession with habit hacking, and about a year ago I decided to give meditation a shot although I felt ridiculous. It was hard for quite a while because my understanding of it was wrong, but once I got down to the core of what meditation was it completely changed my life. The difference was so noticeable that the CTO of my company asked me what had changed in my life. I was more productive, less irritable, and overall just happier. After having someone point this out to me, I dug a little deeper into the effect of meditation and realized that the list is incredible. Developers, designers, and others in tech deal with a lot of stress, self-imposed perfectionism, constant distractions, and even depression. Meditation can help with all of these things to make our lives more enjoyable and make us feel empowered to rise above the current situation. Meditation might not be as flashy as improving the performance of your applications, but for me, this has been much more important.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian deep learning has combined the benefits of probabilistic programming and deep learning to generate scalable model for uncertainty estimates.This approach is a leap towards making artificial intelligence truly intelligent alike humans",
    "description": "While creating model for solution of any real life scenario modelling uncertainty is really important. Traditionally, machine learning provides some approach such as Gaussian Processes for modelling uncertainty but these approaches can't scale to high dimensional inputs like images and videos.\r\nOn the other hand deep learning algorithms are great for high dimensional inputs but struggles to model uncertainty.\r\n\r\nThe solution to the problem described above is the topic of my talk -Bayesian Deep Learning .The talk will be about how probabilistic programming, which has been good in modelling uncertainty and deep neural network, which can scale to high dimensional inputs like images and videos, can be combined into Bayesian Deep Learning which provides a deep learning framework and can also model uncertainty.The talk will cover different types of uncertainties and how to model them with Bayesian approach using python libraries(Edward and ZhuSuan) to create safe A.I. \r\n\r\nI'll utilise the time of my talk as follows:\r\n\r\n0-10 mins: Introduction to the problem in hand, of modelling uncertainty and why deep learning is not \r\n                  good enough for the problem. What is traditional probabilistic approach to the problem and it's \r\n                 shortcomings for high dimensional input, leading to the introduction of Bayesian Deep Learning.\r\n\r\n10-20 mins: Explanation of basic mechanism and mathematics behind Bayesian deep learning with some \r\n                   examples.Description of various types of uncertainties such as Epistemic and Aleatoric which \r\n                   need to be modelled.\r\n\r\n20-30 mins: Introduction to Edward python library and it's usefulness for creating Bayesian deep learning \r\n                     frameworks. Some example problems to show the working of this library .\r\n                     Introduction to ZhuSuan python library and how it is useful in creating Bayesian deep \r\n                     learning framework along with some examples to show it's workings.\r\n\r\n",
    "notes": "I have always been upfront to share cool exciting stuff with the people in general and I believe that Applied PyCon Canada is providing one of such great opportunity. I will be presenting my talk on Bayesian Deep Learning, which is one of the important pillars of making A.I. truly human-like intelligent by including the probability aspect of reality. Recently, I presented my talk in PyCon Thailand 2018 , and I was overwhelmed with the amazing response from the audience who attended my talk\r\n\r\nIn the talk which I am going to present I will be explaining about the importance of  this probability approach along with how and why it  must be used to solve problems in combination with deep learning.Just like Capsule Networks the importance of Bayesian Deep Learning is that it’s not just another method which has improved the accuracy marginally ,but it’s a new paradigm which has changed the whole perspective with which we look at problems in Artificial Intelligence\r\n\r\nThe talk will be quite comprehensive and expect the audience to have basic knowledge of neural networks. It’s not a workshop, so the audience need not worry about technical requirements. I believe I can be a really good addition to the list of speakers and I hope to be there",

    "description": "# Prepare Your Kids to Control Their Future\r\n\r\nYou're probably aware that software engineering is among the fastest-growing career paths in existence today, and it's projected to only get bigger in the next generation.  You may desire for your children to learn these valuable skills, but you may also lack the time, patience, or skill required to teach them.\r\n\r\n## What Options are Out There?\r\n\r\nI'll be frank with you: almost all of the books and courses on the subject of coding--even those directed at children--move at a pace that is much too fast for the average child to follow without additional guidance, explanation, and review from a knowledgeable teacher.\r\n\r\nThose few courses that do move at a child's pace usually suffer from another problem: they teach a simplified, sandboxed coding language--one that is difficult to build upon or develop into any real in-demand skills.  In some ways, this is comparable to your child becoming an expert at a single video game.  It doesn't translate well to actual IT job skills.\r\n\r\nI know this to be true as I have sifted through dozens of books, courses, online tutorials, pdfs, and reviews in my efforts to teach my family of 6 homeschooled children how to code.\r\n\r\n## Save Time and Do What Works!\r\n\r\nThere are a few good resources out there for children of any age to learn coding.  In this entertaining, informative talk, I will break down what works and what doesn't and leave you with many practical action steps to start your children into developing some of the most valuable skills they could ever learn!",

    "title": "Listening to the voice of the data : The importance of exploratory data analysis and data visualization in machine learning",
    "abstract": "Every data set has a unique voice hiding behind it, listening to it helps to obtain confidence in your data to a point where you’re ready to engage a machine learning algorithm.\nWhen you torture a dataset, it can confess just anything but listening to it brings out the voice of its heart.",
    "description": "All the data in the world is useless if you cannot understand it. EDA and data visualization are the most crucial yet overlooked stage in analytics process. This is because they give insights on the most relevant features in a particular data set required to build an accurate model. It is often said that the more the data, the better the model but sometimes, this can be counter-productive as more data can be a disadvantage. EDA helps avoid that.\r\n\r\nEDA is useful for professionals while data visualization is useful for end-users.\r\n\r\nFor end-users: A good sketch is better than a long speech. The value of a machine learning model is not known unless it is used to make data driven decisions. It is therefore necessary for data scientists to master the act of telling a story for their work to stay relevant. This is where data visualization is extremely useful. \r\nWe must remember that the end-users of the results are not professionals like us but people who know little or nothing about data analysis. For effective communication of our analysis, there is need for a detailed yet simple data visualization because the work of a data scientist is not done if data-driven insights and decisions are not made.\r\n\r\nFor professionals: How do you ensure you are ready to use machine learning algorithms in a project? How do you choose the most suitable algorithms for your data set? How do you define the feature variables that can potentially be used for machine learning? Most data scientists ask these questions. EDA answers these questions explicitly. Also, EDA helps in understanding the data. Understanding the data brings familiarity with the data, giving insights on the best models that fit the data set, the features in the dataset that will be useful for building an accurate machine learning model, making feature engineering an easy process.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will give a detailed explanation on what EDA and data visualization are and why they are very helpful in building accurate machine learning models for analytics as well as enhancing productivity and better understanding for clients. I will also discuss the risks of not mastering EDA and data visualization as a data scientist.",
    "notes": "Over the years, machine learning has been on the rise – and that’s given birth to a number of powerful machine learning algorithms. So powerful that they almost tempt you to skip the Exploratory Data Analysis phase. While it’s understandable why you’d want to take advantage of such algorithms and skip the EDA – It is not a very good idea to just feed data into a black box and wait for the results. It has been observed time and time again that Exploratory Data Analysis provides a lot of critical information which is very easy to miss – information that helps the analysis in the long run, from framing questions to displaying results.\r\n\r\nThe focus of EDA is making sense of the data in hand – things like formulating the correct questions to ask to your dataset, how to manipulate the data sources so you can build a relationship with a new data problem to get the required answers \r\n\r\nSome risks of not performing exploratory data analysis includes:\r\n\r\n• Generating inaccurate models\r\n\r\n• Generating accurate models but on the wrong data\r\n\r\n• Not creating the right types of variables in data preparation\r\n\r\n• using resources inefficiently because of realizing only after generating models that perhaps the data is skewed, or has outliers, or has too many missing values, or finding that some values are inconsistent.\r\n\r\n\r\nOutline of this talk\r\n\r\n\tIntroductions \r\n\r\n\tWhat is Data Visualization\r\n\r\n\tCategories of Data visualization\r\n\r\n\tWhat is explanatory data visualization\r\n\r\n\tWhy EDV is important for data scientist\r\n\r\n\tWhat is exploratory data analysis\r\n\r\n\tMethods for EDA \r\n\r\n       •\tUnivariate graphical method\r\n\r\n       •\tUnivariate non graphical method\r\n\r\n       •\tMultivariate graphical method \r\n\r\n       •\tMultivariate non graphical method\r\n\r\n\tBenefits EDA brings to machine learning projects \r\n\r\n     Risks of not mastering EDA and data visualization\r\n\r\n\tKey Takeaways\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Algorithms recognize faces better than you and I can. Language translators went from “source of amusement” to “better than humans”, seemingly overnight. How the heck is that even possible?\r\n\r\nEven with all the hype around Machine Learning, many developers are still wary of it, because it feels so foreign. The field is teeming with math jargon, research-y conventions and, sometimes, bad code. Rather than blog posts, people point you at academic lectures and obscure research papers. For many of us, this stuff is as intimidating as it’s fascinating.\r\n\r\nIn this half-a-day tutorial for Python programmers, I will walk you through the foundations of Machine Learning. You don't need to know the basics: I will lead you from zero to a computer vision program that recognizes hand-written characters. Along the way, I will mostly use code and animations (rather than mathematical formulae) to explain Machine Learning concepts. Get ready to enter a whole new field!\r\n",

    "description": "Flask is great for writing applications of all sizes, from small data APIs to huge social platforms. It's so easy to get started, that even experienced developers may not consider if their app is ready before deploying. Flask does some work for you, but there's a lot that you need to do as well.\r\n\r\nThis talk will give listeners a lexicon of terms and techniques to be aware of when developing a Flask (or Django, etc.) application to stay secure. It will provide a broad overview of topics, rather than covering the technical details of attacks and mitigation in depth. It's appropriate for beginners, but all levels should be aware of these issues.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple layers to a WSGI application, and security is involved in each. Within Flask, issues include escaping user input for XSS, tokens for CSRF, securely signing data, and hashing passwords. Above Flask, at the WSGI and HTTP server, configuration can mitigate DOS attacks, and the server itself should be secured too. Least well known due to its rapid evolution are the various ways to tell modern browsers how to keep the user safe on your site; Flask-Talisman provides a drop-in solution for this. Finally, there are tools and resource to check and keep up to date as these measures continue to evolve.",

    "abstract": "Medicine and Aviation use checklists to allow skilled people to perform repetitive tasks consistently. While operating most software isn't (often) life or death like those industries we can use checklists in order to educate our teammates, and reduce human error.",
    "description": "Growing up I was lucky enough to participate in a program called the \"Young Eagles\". This program was started with the support of aviation pioneer Chuck Yeager and is focused on introducing children to aviation. I participated a number\r\nof times which meant I got to fly in a small airplane. Each time before taking off the pilot would take out a laminated card and read it out loud. As they read each step they would perform a simple action, and make an observation before\r\ncontinuing onto the next step. This pilot has been flying for many years, but **every** they would go through this checklist.\r\n\r\nThis pilot is not alone in using checklists in order to achieve safe operation of their aircraft, but instead exemplifies the culture of the industry. In their book *The Checklist Manifesto* author Atul Gawande tells the story of how a B-\r\n17 (WW2 era bomber aircraft) crashing on take off would lead to the first checklist. This checklist, and it's proliferation led to many tasks of flight being codified with a checklist.\r\n\r\nAtul Gawande's book also describes how checklists improved various tasks in medicine such as running a line (not quite sure what this means, but they say it on Grey's Anatomy all the time), and delivering a baby. Because these tasks had\r\nbeen routine practitioners would accidentally skip steps because their brains disengaged after performing a task for the nth time.\r\n\r\nDeveloping and maintaining software doesn't often pose the same risks as aviation and medicine, however using checklists to consistently perform repetitive tasks is something that our industry could benefit from. Checklists allow us to\r\ntake what we learn from retrospectives and incrementally improve. By using checklists as a living document for the canonical way to perform a specific task we can educate one another and learn from past mistakes.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I would also like to talk about:\r\n\r\n- [ ] How checklists intersect with automation. Since some aspect of repeatable tasks can be automated using scripts what should be performed by a human and what should be scripted.\r\n- [ ] What makes a good checklist. What makes a checklist useful and something that you and your team would **want** to use rather than something you and your team **should** use.\r\n- [ ] (if there is time) What are some ways to keep a collection of checklists up to date.",

Django REST  framework and  Flask are the main two popular  choices, but you may not yet have heard of the extermly friendly \"hug\"\r\n\r\n[HUG API](http://www.hug.rest/): is a library that provides a very simple way to create custom REST APIs for various services. By using some of the language features in Python, much of the usual boilerplate normally required when creating APIs for web services is removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Part 2\r\nHug goes a long way to make you feel welcome. And that’s it! We can immediately test our APIs. You could use a web browser for this, or you can use a tool like cURL\r\nYou call: the URL endpoint with the correct parameters, and hug returns the response\r\n\r\nIt’s impressive to create live web API up with so little work. And the features don’t stop there: \r\nhug can automatically generates API documentation, which is what you get by missing an endpoint:\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ curl http://localhost:8000/\r\n\r\n{\"404\": \"The API call you tried to make was not defined. Here's a definition of the API to help you get going :)\",\r\n  \"documentation\": {\r\n    \"overview\": \"A basic (single function) API written using Hug\",\r\n    \"handlers\": {\r\n      \"/happy_birthday\": {\r\n        \"GET\": {\r\n          \"usage\": \"Says happy birthday to a user\",\r\n          \"examples\": [\r\n            \"http://localhost:8000/happy_birthday?name=HUG\u0026age=1\"\r\n          ],\r\n          \"outputs\": {\r\n            \"format\": \"JSON (Javascript Serialized Object Notation)\",\r\n            \"content_type\": \"application/json\"\r\n          },\r\n          \"inputs\": {\r\n            \"name\": {\r\n              \"type\": \"Basic text / string value\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"age\": {\r\n              \"type\": \"A Whole number\"\r\n\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n--- \r\n# HUG in Action\r\n---\r\n\r\n# \u003ccenter\u003e![](./arch.png)\u003ccenter\u003e\r\n  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Demo\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Q\u0026A \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We will learn how the two can be linked and used to deploy a complete Django stack; the example will highlight the one of the biggest advantages of the approach - freedom from cloud vendor lock-in - so you can be confident your stack is easily movable from one infrastructure provider to another.\r\n\r\nThe tutorial will be partly based on the terrasalt open source project, link: https://github.com/bigbitbus/terrasalt",

(http://www.bigbitbus.com/); our blog posts as well as our cloud-comparison tools derive all data from infrastructure spun up using the Terraform+Salt stack.\r\n\r\nWorking code and examples are in this OSS project: https://github.com/bigbitbus/terrasalt",

I will be presenting it at a regional conference in Winnipeg, Prarie Dev Con), in late October.\r\n\r\nThe hands-on part of the second half will be very similar to the demo part of the same presentation, presented twice as mentioned above, but I’ll switch the examples to web server logs and some large fake client data sets as might be explored by someone maintaining a web server as part of diagnosis or understanding users, or an analyst answering questions about a client base.\r\n\r\nIn the the last part I’ll explore and prepare some analyses and choose one that is engaging by being specific to the conference, Winnipeg, or Manitoba, but not too complicated so it’s understandable in under 15 minutes and can be extended by participants after the session.\r\n\r\nIdeas so far include: - Semantic analysis of tweets of past conferences or the one in progress during the presentation - Winnipeg Transit API data - not very interesting but I’m familiar with it - Winnipeg Traffic System data on traffic signals across the city\r\n\r\nThe Anaconda installation mentioned in the description is very straightforward. For student that forget to download it beforehand I’ll bring some thumb drives. The Jupyter Lab interface mixes documentation, code, and visualization so it will be easy for participants to work in it during or after the session with fairly little oversight.

Since API's are essential for mobile and web apps, this tutorial is a way to help beginner pythonistas get their app users logged in, and use authentication on each request for their API. It will lead them through creating a Django project, installing the packages required, creating the authentication and then ultimately going through a basic Django project to create an authenticated API. It will also lead attendees through using some useful tools for testing and debugging Restful APIs on their own.\r\nThis course has been presented before at the Edmontonpy meetup to a crowd of 30-40 pythonistas, in June 2018.

Managing library material via the typical web based OPAC (online public\r\naccess catalogue) of one's public library leaves much to be desired. In the age of Siri, Alexa, Cortana, Google\r\nAssistant, etc why can't one manage one's library membership via text messaging or voice? Since the author didn't\r\nknow, he set out to find answers through prototyping a simple conversational agent (the Library Patron Agent),\r\nfocusing on the Amazon Alexa SDK. And the author could not think of a better language to prototype than Python.\r\nPython figures prominently both in the construction of the web back-end server, as well as various command-line\r\nutilities for language model construction.  In the course of developing the LPA, more questions than answers were\r\ncreated. However two questions will be addressed: is it feasible for an application to support multiple voice SDKs?;\r\nwhat is the division of NLP labour between the front-end and backend? One thing is certain, how one answers these questions has a profound impact on architecture and the tool-chain.\r\n\r\nIntroduction (\u003c 5 minutes)\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n   - Demo \"Please renew my copy of Tom Sawyer\" \r\n     - renewed by voice and sms\r\n   - A description of the Library Patron Agent \r\n   - Why this is a toy (hint lack of standardised API for library circulation)? \r\n   - Two questions\r\n       - what would happen if I wanted to support Google Assistant or Siri too?\r\n       -  how does Alexa, Google Assistant, etc know Tom Sawyer is short for Adventures of Tom Sawyer?

    "abstract": "This presentation will look into the inner mechanics of Python in an attempt to suggest a different approach to writing Python code. In doing so, we will offer suggestions about how to make your Python code perform better.",
    "description": "The original idea for this presentation stems from a passion for code performance and reverse engineering.\r\nWhile there is a wealth of information on how to make C or C++ code faster, there is generally a lack of deep understanding of the Python interpreter preventing Python programmers from achieving what we call “conscious programming”. To elaborate, programmers often have to resort to using known best practices, sometimes without knowing why a given technique is faster, or more advisable, than another one. Obviously, using best practices is often enough. However it is our opinion that in order to own the craft of programming, programmers should be able to obtain and understand second level knowledge about how their tools and computer actually execute the code they are writing.\r\nIn this talk we will use a case well-known in the Python community: List comprehension vs. Loop for list initialization. However, we will explore it from the point of view of a reverse engineer and treat the code the same way C code would be treated. In doing so, we will question the way code is executed and suggest alternative or interesting angles to apply to programming in Python.\r\nIt should also be noted that in this talk, we purposefully chose to present the subject in the context of the current environmental crisis. Indeed, more performant code would run faster thus use less power to do the same job, potentially resulting in impressive savings in power consumption.\r\nThis presentation has never been presented and has been prepared specially for the PyCon conference.",
    "notes": "There are no special requirement for this talk other than a projector and screen.\r\nBased on my reverse engineering experience, I was often exposed to low level code (machine code level). From this, I developed a passion for code performance and code reading. That is also when I first noticed many errors (performance related) I was doing when writing higher level code. Learning how to write assembly code changed the way I write higher level code. Indeed, that gave me insights into how my higher level code was being translated for the computer to execute. However, even with this knowledge, languages like Python often poses a performance challenge. This is because the language uses an interpreter. This presentation was therefore born from a desire to explore python and its inner working in a quest to learn how to write better python code. My objective is to deliver a python performance related talk that can appeal to all programmers. The hope is that more and more programmers develop an interest into code performance and that we can collectively write greener code.",

    "abstract": "Your training, experience, and passion are all in computer programming, but sometimes you feel like a locomotive stuck on the track toward management. It's not true: you can deepen your skills, get promoted, and expand your influence as an individual contributor for the rest of your career.",
    "description": "No Q \u0026 A during the time slot, but I'll encourage people to come talk with me in the hallway afterward.\r\n\r\n(5 minutes) *Your career, on rails.* It often feels like when you reach a point of seniority, you inexorably become a manager. I experienced this once: I was a senior engineer due for a promotion, and I was forced to choose between two bad options. Either I could become a manager, swapping the job I enjoyed and did well, for a job I had not been trained for and didn't want to do. Or, I could refuse the promotion. What I actually did was quit and go freelance in order to get off the management track. But more recently I've joined a company that provides me an alternative.\r\n\r\n(6 minutes) *The hidden rail switch.* There is another track available. Some companies offer a promotion path that allows you to expand your influence and responsibility without becoming a manager. When you switch onto this track you can continue advancing without giving up the work you love.\r\n\r\n(8 minutes) *The adventurous route.* What does a very senior individual contributor do? Mentor junior engineers, and teach them to be mentors. Advise managers. Design very large, complex products. Establish practices and processes. Save projects in crisis. Write and speak in public, and coach others who want to write and speak. Unlike management, this track requires you to invent ways to spread your ideas.\r\n\r\n(9 minutes) *Risks of derailment.* A senior individual contributor still codes, but you will code less than you did. You must relinquish some of your favorite coding work, and learn to enjoy writing designs and doing code reviews. You must find unorthodox ways to lead without commanding, e.g. by teaching classes or writing guides. You must learn to be satisfied by the spectacular achievements of the people you help, rather than by your personal achievements. Just like the management track, this track leads toward selflessness.\r\n\r\n(2 minute) *Plan your route.* If you have a passion for management, by all means do it. We need good managers with coding experience. But if you don't want to manage, seek the hidden switch. Work for a company with a career path for individual contributors, or demand that your employer creates one.",

When it comes to deploy ML model on production environment and scale it as a service, all nuts \u0026 bolts get into problems. As Kubernetes has become an industrial de facto standard for containerized orchestration, other applications integration with Kubernetes became mandatory. \r\n\r\nML deployments are so tied to the environment it has developed, Meaning that moving model from a local machine to highly scalable cluster environment sometimes requires almost entire re-engineering of architecture. Mostly Data Scientist would love to spend more time in tuning ML model, applying new algorithms, changing the architecture of ML model etc, they don’t get time to take care of DevOps / environments related stuff for scaling. To save effort and time of Data Scientist and to avoid introducing an extra bug in transition. “Kubeflow” Introduces ML stacks on Kubernetes: Being an easy, portable, scalable, fast and extensible. Kubeflow provides ML model Inference anywhere!\r\n\r\nThis talk is intent to present : \r\n- An Introduction to Kubeflow with ksonnet setup for Machine Learning models with various components.\r\n- Role of kubeflow in Scalable Data Engineering and Data Science Architectures with various other pythonist data pipelines such as Spark on Kubernetes talking to ML model on Kubeflow.",

    "description": "The Future of ChatBots in the Travel Industry\r\nIntroduction\r\nImagine the future where an intelligent assistant suggests you places you could visit on the weekend. And plans the whole trip for you as well. The bot already knows your preferences and previous experiences, and makes you an offer you cannot refuse. Won't that be wonderful? This is the near future, my friends.\r\nEveryone who loves to travel wants to have a smooth travel experience. ChatBots are trying to serve the needs of the users, coming up with content personalized according to each user. Wouldn’t you want to search for a hotel on the fly without setting up a plan to find the perfect getaway holiday for you? ChatBots in the travel industry are changing our overall experience and expectations of the trip. I believe natural interfaces will play a major role in e-commerce.\r\n\r\nHow does it work? \r\nThere are a lot of stages that are involved in processing the sentence that the user says, and coming up with an intelligent reply: \r\n1) The intent of the message (Book a hotel, Customer Support, Filters, Sorters, etc.)\r\n2) Keeping in mind the previous conversations. \r\n3) Understand if the user is conveying something particular (Number of people in the trip, Number of days, Currency, Exact dates, Not sure about the dates etc.)\r\n4) Figure out when the user comes back after a certain amount of time, if they are starting a new conversation, or continuing the same one. \r\n\r\nThese are some of the parts that needs to taken care of before coming up with reply. Each of these parts are handled separately. \r\n\r\nThere are two major parts of the ChatBot: \r\n1) The brain of the Bot: Talks to the user, identifies if it can reply directly, or needs Natural Language Understanding to parse the intent of the user, and then come up with a smart and relevant reply. \r\n2) NLU (Natural Language Understanding) : This part of the bot parses the sentences and comes up with intents in the message with some confidence. \r\n\r\nWhy is this important? \r\n1) Mobile App time Spent Grows 69% Year-Over-Year.\r\n2) There are ~1.3 billion active users on Facebook. ChatBots have the potential to impact their lives and help them with their travel needs.\r\n3) Chat outperforms voice in user tests as people perceive chat to be more natural, faster, and more intelligent . \r\n",

Sharing this experience with the audience will be intriguing for them, and will keep them involved in the talk. I will share some insights which will look pretty straight-forward but when we ponder on them, the audience will feel that those insights indeed play an important role in designing the ChatBot. ",

    "description": "A parser turns strings to useful tree shaped data structures. Parsers are typically used as a first step in an interpreter or compiler. Throughout a demo, I will describe an easy way for making a parsing library that is powerful enough to parse Python syntax and many other languages. It is based on the thesis \"Experimenting with Programming Languages\" by Alessandro Warth, with some modifications.\r\n\r\nDepending on the time left, a number of examples use cases for this parsing technique will be shown amongst:\r\n\r\n- A grammar for bootstrapping the parser itself\r\n- A pretty printer\r\n- An interpreter for some of the Python language\r\n- A C implementation\r\n- An x86 assembly implementation\r\n- A graphical user interface toolkit maker\r\n\r\nAlso if time permits, I will show how to debug in this parsing library.\r\n\r\n# More information for reviewers\r\n\r\nThis talk is a trimmed down version of a 90 minutes presentation given at the local Papers We Love meetup.

All the Python code shown will be fairly simple. However, the new concept does take some time to absorb for those not used to it.\r\n\r\nAt the Papers We Love presentation, the audience was pretty engaged the entire time despite the length of the talk and many came to tell me they enjoyed it.

While is it exciting and rewarding to share your ideas with the world it isn't always easy. Thinking about licenses, copyrights, and protect confidential information is a must!",
    "description": "Working in a large organization which is embracing the mantra \"open source first\" is really exciting. Part of this journey is to make sure we give back to the open source community when we can. Two of our projects had gained traction internally: `datacompy`, and `locopy`. As part of our commitment we wanted to make sure we could open source these projects for others to use and contribute back to.\r\n\r\nDataComPy is a package to compare two Pandas DataFrames. Originally started to be something of a replacement for SAS's PROC COMPARE for Pandas DataFrames with some more functionality than just Pandas.DataFrame.equals(Pandas.DataFrame) (in that it prints out some stats, and lets you tweak how accurate matches have to be). Then extended to carry that functionality over to Spark Dataframes.\r\n\r\nLocopy helps load flat files to S3 and then to Amazon Redshift, and assist with ETL processing. It is DB Driver (Adapter) agnostic, provides basic functionality to move data to S3 buckets, execute COPY commands to load data to S3, and into Redshift, and UNLOAD commands to unload data from Redshift into S3.\r\n\r\nWhile building these products was exciting and fun, some of the legal considerations were as interesting, complex, and required collaboration between many teams, from security, licensing, brand, and IP/copyright. We'll explore the projects, and some of these other considerations which can make or break if you decide to release a project into the wild, along with the road blocks we faced with in these areas.",

    "abstract": "Python is showing an incredible growth in many fields, including academia. By enumerating the challenges we face in sustainable research software development and how Python's unique strengths are catering to them, I hope to explain this growth and encourage further adoption for scientific computing!",
    "description": "There is a good reason why more Americans have searched for Python than for Kim Kardashian in the last year. In fact, there are many good reasons, for why Python is undergoing incredible growth in broad array of fields. In this talk, I focus on its growth in research software development. I would start by enumerating the [many] desirable qualities and requirements for sustainable research software development. They include being highly readable, having low barriers to learn and collaborate, rapid prototyping, ability to easily grow a script into a big project, and the ability to quickly make packages of all sizes distributable. In addition, support for data gathering (esp. over the web), high interoperability with other languages (for pipeline building) and high-performance computing are highly desirable, given the complexity and size of the academic data is only growing. Then, I hope to show how the unique strengths of Python are catering to these requirements well. In addition, combined with a strong undercurrent of open source, multidisciplinary research and need for web-accessibility, python is proving to be ideal for research software development. \r\n\r\nMoreover, I hope to convey the recommendations from the academic/research software community to further improve the status quo, such as leaning towards open software validation as a scientific society, establishing easy and agnostic validation guidelines, and badges to encourage the adoption of best practices, eventually leading to their endorsement. As it is difficult to communicate this multi-dimensional topic, I encourage you to read my blog post on this topic, focused on neuroinformatics can be found on my blogpost: https://crossinvalidation.com/2018/05/03/lets-focus-our-neuroinformatics-community-efforts-in-python-and-on-software-validation/\r\n\r\nThanks and looking forward to joining PyCon folks!",
    "notes": "Why am I the best person to speak on this subject? I have 10+ years in developing multidisciplinary research software at the intersection of computer scientists and clinicians. Having started in Matlab and then moving to Python entirely, and working with diverse stakeholders in academia, I've lived experience in the problems I have identified. Hence, I believe my suggestions are relatable, applicable and valuable to many working scientists in neuroscience and beyond.",

One of the challenges in architecting and building deep learning systems are the areas of maintainability, scalability and deployments. I would like to discuss on how we solve this at omnius.",
    "description": "Building technology platforms with AI systems requires a lot more thought process in terms of architecture and choice of tooling. The reason for this is because there is need for brainstorming around scaling, monitoring, deploying and managing the deep learning service as you would manage any other service. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will be talking about how to take Deep Learning systems to production with the use of packages and tools like:\r\n\r\n* Keras / Tensorflow / Pytorch - Deep learning frameworks providing the flexibility to write custom deep learning functions with lower level APIs \r\n\r\n* Flask - Flask is a micro web-framework that allows you to write REST endpoints with minimal effort. Its simple and easy to use. When paired up with Gunicorn, you can take it into production with no effort. The idea of using Flask is to provide REST end points for prediction.\r\n\r\n* Kubernetes \u0026 Docker- Managing microservices which have a bunch of dependencies is hard to manage. Docker provides the capability of putting all the required pieces of software to run a service into one single logical box, thereby managing all the dependencies with ease. \r\nKubernetes on the other hand provides the capability to orchestrate and manage these docker containers and manage the infrastructure in automated fashion with inbuilt service discovery, load balancing, self correction systems.\r\n\r\n* ElasticSearch, Logstash \u0026 Kibana - Logging is one of the most crucial components of managing and running systems in production. With ELK, you can ship and manage logs from various services and this provides a way to evaluate how the prediction system is working in production.\r\n\r\n* Prometheus - A tool to monitor Kubernetes clusters. This is a neat dashboard integrated with Grafana that shows the consumption of CPU and memory for systems in production, helping in evaluating how big or small the clusters should be in order to keep up with SLAs. \r\n\r\n* Model Versioning - A model versioning system implemented in python to manage deep learning models and version them, thereby providing the capability to reproduce the results from various experiments.\r\n\r\n* Managing Data sets - An introduction to Git LFS and how to manage datasets. Extremely useful when working with the thought process of reproducible results. \r\n\r\nThe focus of this talk to is to shed light on the qualms of architecting, devops and management of deep learning systems in production.",
    "notes": "Over the years have realized the complexity of taking data science systems into production and I would like to shed some light on this area with the proposed talk. \r\nHave previously spoken at various Data science conferences like  Strata San Jose,PyData london, Pycon Czech Republic, FifthElephant Bangalore and AntHill Bangalore.\r\nExtremely passionate about architecting, scaling and managing data science systems.",

Playing angklung in this way is fun but also presents some challenges that are hard to solve manually. I will show you how Python-based algorithms can be used to improve the quality of life of angklung players and managers, by helping calculate the most optimal distribution, highlighting conflict areas and missing angklung areas, and presenting it in a user-friendly interface. In addition, Python also plays a role in easing the pains of transforming western music notation to traditional musical notation ([Cipher notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbered_musical_notation)).

    "description": "There is a life cycle all of its own when learning something new even if that is leveling up your current skills. The natural ups and downs on the path to progress can cause learners to become stuck, encounter mental blocks, or even give up altogether. As a former college professor in the field of education, I can say with certainty, a little knowledge about educational psychology (lovingly referred to as brain science) goes a long way when you want to be a successful programmer. Educational psychology as a field studies how people learn new concepts efficiently and effectively and applies that to teaching methods and study strategies for promoting and achieving mastery.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, I cover 5 principles of educational psychology, connect that principle with common learning situations in learning code (emphasis on frontend), and then provide suggested resources for success. The goal of the presentation is for you take charge of your learning and persevere.\r\n\r\nIf you think this presentations is just for beginners, you would be wrong.

My attempts at becoming profitable in Daily Fantasy Sports\r\n**Duration:** 10 min\r\n**Language:** English\r\n**Level:** Beginner\r\n**Categories:** `data science`, `sports`, `machine learning`, `optimization`, `data infrastructure`, `web scraping`\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n=======\r\nOver the past decade, Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) has exploded into a multi-billion dollar industry. With the promises of riches, thousands of people flooded onto sites like Fanduel and Draftkings. This talk will highlight my journey as one of these people, armed with a single tool: Python.\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will show how I built out an end-to-end DFS optimization system using just Python. I will start by briefly talking about the DFS industry, and how the competitions work. With this background knowledge, I will walk through the different phases of of my journey in becoming competitive in DFS: getting data, building predictions, generating lineups, stacking, backtesting different strategies, and deploying these live strategies.\r\n\r\nThe talk outline will be something like this:\r\n\r\n**Intro to DFS** (1 minutes)\r\n\r\n- talk about the major players in DFS, basic idea of how DFS works\r\n- talk about what goes into setting a fantasy lineup: predictions, salaries, \u0026 actual starting lineups\r\n- briefly discuss the different types of contests (tournaments vs. head to head vs. 50-50s etc.), and the slates (early games, all games, late night games etc.)\r\n\r\n**Getting Historical Performance Data** (1 minutes)\r\n\r\n- highlight where to find data for each sport I looked at: NHL, NBA and MLB\r\n- talk about the other data sources you need to build out your strategy\r\n    - starting lineups, vegas odds, weather data, fantasy point projections\r\n- discuss some of the challenges of working with this data\r\n    - web scraping is messy\r\n    - players names are spelt differently on different sites\r\n    - some sites can't be scraped with requests and need more advanced methods, like selenium\r\n\r\n**Building Predictions** (2 minutes)\r\n\r\n- talk about the player modeling I did\r\n    - the types of features I built\r\n    - combining my model scores with other fantasy projection sources (rotogrinder, dailyfantasynerd)\r\n    - the different model algorithms I tried, and how they compared\r\n\r\n**Generating Lineups** (2 minutes)\r\n\r\n- talk about lineup optimization\r\n    - what are we trying to optimize? \r\n        - total projected fantasy points (mean projection vs. highest possible score)\r\n    - what are the different lineup constraints? (number of players required at each position)\r\n    - how can you perform optimization in Python\r\n- discuss some of the unique strategies I took using \"stacking\"\r\n    - stacking is the concept of adding or removing certain players based on factors like: are they in the same lineup (in real life), are they on a powerplay together, will they steal shot attempts from each other, is this player playing against a certain goalie from another team etc.\r\n\r\n**Backtesting Different Strategies** (2 minutes)\r\n\r\n- provide an overview of my backtesting process\r\n- show how performance varied across different competition types \u0026 slates\r\n- talk about the initial strategy that was taken for my pilot\r\n\r\n**Going Live** (2 minutes)\r\n\r\n- talk about the additional infrastructure required for going in live competitions\r\n    - ongoing ETL processes\r\n    - productionizing models\r\n    - automating lineup entries in fanduel\r\n- talk about the immediate learnings from my initial competitions \r\n\r\n**Wrapping Up** (1 minute)\r\n\r\n- lessons learned\r\n    - leakage of \"future data\" into our models and lineup optimizers\r\n    - valuing the importance of better models\r\n    - targeting specific competition types and slates\r\n- things I would have done differently\r\n- thoughts on DFS, how to be competitive, and most importantly: whether it's worth it\r\n\r\n**Questions** (1 minute)\r\n End with time for the audience to ask questions.\r\n\r\nThe main repo used for this project is private, but you can look at some individual player modeling I did for the NBA here: https://github.com/ian-whitestone/nba-dfs.\r\n\r\nAbout Me\r\n===========\r\n\r\nAs a student of Chemical Engineering at Queen's University, Ian was pursuing a career back home in Calgary in the Oil \u0026 Gas industry.

In addition, we will compare model performances between our homemade model, readily-available libraries (OpenFace), and PaaS alternatives (Clarifai).",
    "description": "Deep learning is a booming machine-learning technique which we often read in a lot of articles nowadays. Deep learning sounds like an intimidating concept for a lot of people, but everyone believes that deep learning is a cutting-edge tool to solve a lot of problems. In this talk, we will see how Python and various open-source tools are very easy to use and very powerful for solving deep learning problems. For the study case, we will have a 30-minute journey in revisiting image recognition problem with anime characters.\r\n\r\nI will briefly explain how traditional machine learning works with TensorFlow and introduces some alternatives tools out there. After that, we will see how deep learning enhances our knowledge in the traditional machine learning and how we can get more benefits from it. All of these examples will be presented in the context of image recognition problem, and while on it, we will also see the use cases of other tools, such as OpenCV, OpenFace, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the main part of the talk, we will see that images of anime characters are limited by nature, since it totally depends on number of existing fan arts. In addition, 3D model (human face) cannot be applied directly in solving this problem since 2D model (anime character face) totally depends on the illustrator. Therefore, we will explore how we can utilize transfer learning for model training with small amount of dataset. Finally, we will build our own simple app with Sanic to serve our ready-built model for other users.\r\n\r\nThis talk will introduce the concept of deep learning, transfer learning, and how we can apply it to our own existing problems. In addition, we will present some alternative PaaS as a comparison to build a model from scratch.\r\n\r\nThe project itself is available in 2 Github repositories: [freedomofkeima/transfer-learning-anime](https://github.com/freedomofkeima/transfer-learning-anime) and [freedomofkeima/MoeFlow](https://github.com/freedomofkeima/MoeFlow).",

    "description": "Numpy is the de-facto choice for performing array-based operations while PyTorch is largely used as [\"a deep learning framework for fast, flexible experimentation\"](https://pytorch.org/). Even though the two descriptions sound different, both the libraries provide access to a powerful N-dimensional array (or as we say in PyTorch - tensor). PyTorch supports tensor computations (similar to Numpy) with strong GPU acceleration. In some sense, PyTorch can be used as a replacement for Numpy to use the power of GPUs (even if your use-case is not a machine learning use case). The cost of converting a numpy ndarray to torch tensor is quite negligible as they share the same storage. Unfortunately, PyTorch cannot be used like a drop-in replacement for Numpy though PyTorchs is [\"expect to get closer and closer to NumPy’s API where appropriate\"](https://pytorch.org/2018/01/19/a-year-in.html)\r\n\r\nContent:\r\n\r\n* One slide about \"what is Numpy\"\r\n* Few slides about \"what is ndarray\" and \"operations supported\" by ndarray.\r\n    * These slides would not go into the internals and are presented to keep the presentation self-contained.\r\n* Few slides about \"what is PyTorch\"\r\n    * These slides would provide a brief background information about PyTorch\r\n* Few slides about \"what is torch.Tensor\"\r\n* One slide about how to convert Numpy ndarray to torch Tensor and vice-versa\r\n* Some slides about syntactical similarities and difference between the two apis\r\n    * This would be a very important part of the presentation.\r\n    * Here we would spend time on subtle differences between the two apis - eg Numpy uses `axis` while PyTorch uses `dim` and gotchas to look out for.\r\n    * We would talk about operations that are not yet supported in PyTorch.\r\n    * A small pointer about the performance of PyTorch tensors and Numpy ndarrays.\r\n    * I am expecting a few questions from the audience during this part\r\n* Some slides about moving tensors to GPU\r\n    * How to move tensor\r\n    * Things to take care of - eg do not move data between every operation.

    "description": "Discovering Python\r\n================\r\n\r\nI went from using spreadsheets, Visual Basic and SQL to using Python’s Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas and SQLite3. Before 2016 I primarily used spreadsheets and code written in VBA or small C programs to process data. In 2013, I began processing ever larger amount of stock data, maintenance records, and text with spreadsheets and VBA. I found myself limited by the tools I was using. Then in 2016, a friend recommended that I learn Python. Actually he had recommended that I use Python in 2014 but I ignored him. I started in earnest in 2016 and now I recommend Python to everyone.\r\n\r\nLooking at Data\r\n=============\r\n\r\nI have always looked at data and tried to understand it. As a professional, I have looked at all kinds of data for planning, project costing, financial evaluations, and maintenance activities. As an amateur I have looked at stock financials and prices, housing prices, and currency data.\r\n \r\nOne of the worst things about a spreadsheet is losing track of the data transformations that you have performed. Unless I was very careful I could never repeat my data transformations with a spreadsheet. With Jupyter Notebooks, built in data types, Pandas and SQLite3 I have totally changed how I work with data. \r\n      \r\nLearning Plan for Python \r\n====================\r\n\r\nMy talk outlines a learning plan to step into Python quickly.

I am investigating the evolution of a highly efficient alternative photosynthetic pathway in plants known as C4 photosynthesis.  The C4 pathway has evolved independently nearly 70 times in different flowering plant lineages, making it one of the most remarkably convergent traits know.  The highly convergent nature of C4 photosynthesis means that to fully understand it, we must study diverse species of plants where the evolutionary transition has occurred.  This in turn means spending a lot of time working with non-model organisms, for which sequenced genomes and other resources are virtually non-existent.

    "title": "A Deep Learning Approach to Annotating de novo Transcriptome Assemblies",
    "abstract": "In computational biology, assembling transcriptomes without a reference genome poses a challenge and results in many variant assemblies for each gene.  Artificial neural networks, implemented in Python, perform very well for classifying and clustering these variants and selecting a best isoform.",
    "description": "###The Problem:\r\n\r\nThe genomes of higher eukaryotic organisms are often large and costly to sequence.  For many research applications, working with transcriptomes (using RNA rather than DNA to sequence only actively expressed genes while avoiding the large regions of \"junk\" DNA between coding regions) represents a much more cost-effective alternative.  However, in the absence of a reference genome, *de novo* assembly of RNA-seq data represents a considerable computational challenge: differences in gene expression can lead to transcript abundance levels that vary by several orders of magnitude, complicating detection of sequencing errors, while alternative splice isoforms (which exist for many genes in most eukaryotes) are very difficult to resolve.\r\n\r\n###The Solution:\r\n\r\nWhen transcriptome assemblies are aligned in pairs, it is easy for a human observer to distinguish whether they represent variant assemblies of the same gene or genuinely different but related genes based on how sequence variation is distributed across the alignment.  However, the sheer volume of pairwise alignments that would need to be sorted makes the manual approach highly intractable.  Enter Python: properly trained artificial neural networks can perform tens of thousands of such classification tasks in seconds.  And the excellent Python libraries Keras and Tensorflow make implementing, training, and deploying such neural networks straightforward.\r\n\r\n###This Talk Will Cover:\r\n\r\n- Identification and framing of the problem\r\n- The process of generating and curating a large volume of suitable training data\r\n- Experiments with a variety of neural network architectures (convolutional, recurrent, and hybrid)\r\n- A final multi-network approach which achieves \u003e99% classification accuracy\r\n- A full pipeline built around this classifier to build a network of assembly variants and choose a best isoform for each cluster\r\n- The results of this pipeline on real \"data from the wild\" - *de novo* transcriptome assemblies of two plant species",
    "notes": "I have spent my entire PhD tackling computational problems associated with working on non-model organisms, which lack genomic resources.  I've developed many Python applications to bridge some of the gaps between existing bioinformatics tools and make more sense of what is often very noisy data, especially when it comes to transcriptomes.  I am a new practitioner of deep learning and, thanks to the ease with which a variety of neural network architectures can be developed in Python libraries such as Keras and Tensorflow, I have already successfully applied these techniques to a major challenge in computational biology.  One of the major take-home points I would like to make with this talk is that deep learning is, right now, more accessible than ever and can be used to solve a wide variety of problems.  I hope to encourage others to get into this field and start applying these techniques to new problems.\r\n\r\nAn earlier version of this research was presented last month at Plant Biology 2018, a joint meeting of the American and Canadian societies of plant biology (ASPB and CSPB) in the form of a short \"lightning talk\" and a poster presentation.  Both the talk and the poster were met with great enthusiasm, both by biologists working with *de novo* transcriptome assemblies and individuals with an interest in deep learning.",

    "description": "The Internet is a network of networks, based on the Internet Protocol (IP). Internet Exchanges (IXs) have an efficiency role in the infrastructure. At an IX like TorIX, the networks of Internet Service Providers (ISPs), telecommunications carriers, content providers, webhosters and the like, meet to exchange IP traffic with one another. This exchanging of regional, national and/or international IP traffic is generally known as \"peering\". \r\n\r\nEvery peer at the IX is in the position to exchange traffic directly with any of the other connected parties.  In general, parties peer at an IX to decrease network costs, to improve network performance and to make their network more reliable. Improving network performance is achieved by accessing many networks directly at the exchange that otherwise would have taken several network 'hops' through other parties. The reliability is achieved by having many routes at the exchange through which traffic can be sent. Into play comes also that peering networks prefer the autonomy over their own network and traffic.\r\n\r\nIn the new world, large cloud providers are connecting directly to the IXs to become closer to their customers. In recent years TorIX has seen an exponential amount of Enterprise customers take advantage of also peer directly with the IX primary to have a large lower latency connection to there cloud providers and also benefit from other Content Delivery Networks and major network providers.\r\n\r\n \r\nWe are discussing the access to  an online tool to allow companies to show the network path of how their customers reach them in Canada and also the path they use to reach their own services.",

    "title": "Automate the Boring Stuff: Using Python to Improve University Courses",
    "abstract": "One course at McMaster University spends over twenty thousand dollars per semester on TA salary. Over the past 16 months, we have designed and implemented software tools that automate and streamline a significant amount of TA duties in this course.",
    "description": "## Motivation for Project\r\nLike most other engineering schools, McMaster University has a first year computer aided design course. Generally, students enjoy this class because they get to 3D model interesting mechanisms. The course teaching assistants do not enjoy the class as much because they have to mark the students’ 3D models. Not only is the 3D model marking process extremely tedious, it is also incredibly boring.\r\n\r\nTo manually mark the 3D models, TAs have to open each student submission and visually compare the model to the answer file. Since this process is highly subjective, it leads to a high level of inconsistency among student grades.\r\n\r\n### Implementation of Project\r\nA year ago, I started developing a web application (CADGrader) that would solve these issues. CADGrader was successfully implemented at McMaster University during the 2017-2018 school year. Over 900 students, TAs, and faculty members used CADGrader over the course of two semesters. The engineering faculty renewed use of CADGrader for the upcoming school year.\r\n\r\nI built the CADGrader website with three key objectives: dramatically reduce the time TAs spent marking assignments; decrease the discrepancy between student grades; integrate all assignment processing components(assignment marking, student feedback, student help, assignment file storage, etc) in one application.\r\n\r\nThe finished program is an online website that automatically marks CAD files. On the website, TAs can review marked assignments and ensure that the software graded each file correctly. Also, TAs can provide assignment feedback directly to the students via the website. Moreover, Students have access to an assignment checker on the website. Using the assignment checker, students can upload practice CAD assignments and receive a real time grade from the software.\r\n\r\n### How CADGrader Works\r\nStudent assignments are uploaded directly to the CADGrader website. CADGrader objectively grades assignments by comparing each student file with the correct answer file. Using numpy-stl(a python library), CAGrader converts each 3D model into a 3D matrix. With numerical analysis, CADGrader measures the similarity between these different matrices and assigns a grade accordingly. After CADGrader marks each submission, the software distributes the assignments to the course TAs for review. Within the software, TAs can view each assignment and ensure that the files were marked correctly. The assignment viewer allows TAs to view a student file and answer file at the same time. TAs can send feedback to the student through this modal, as well. CADGrader automatically flags assignments that receive abnormally low marks. This prompts TAs to pay extra attention to these assignments. \r\n\r\nOn CADGrader, students have access to a Practice CAD tool. Students can upload completed CAD assignments to the tool and CADGrader instantly grades the assignment for the student. This feature allows students to practice CAD on their own time. The most common question that TAs receive from students is whether or not their CAD model is correct. The Practice CAD tool answers this question for students and frees up time for TAs. This allows TAs to focus on the students that need the most help in the course.\r\n\r\n### Python and Software using in CADGrader\r\nPython forms the cornerstone of CADGrader’s infrastructure. Numpy and numpy-stl are used extensively to analyze the CAD files. Additionally, python is used to make SQL queries. A large amount of the functionality on the CADGrader website is built with JavaScript. The website runs python code with AJAX calls and CGI scripts. \r\n\r\n### Future of Project\r\nAt the beginning of this project, my intention was to build a software product that allowed the university to reduce TA hours. I later realized that humans and machines are best suited for different tasks. Software should handle grunt and menial tasks while humans work on the more intellectually challenging issues. By automating the boring stuff, the TAs’ jobs became much more enjoyable. I have personally seen TAs transition from begrudgingly filling out long Excel sheets to enthusiastically explaining course concepts to students. \r\n\r\nThis shift in thinking has drastically changed my future UX designs. I no longer see the software and TAs as competing entities. Instead, CADGrader has become a tool that allows teaching assistants to be more successful at their jobs.",
    "notes": "Over the past 16 months, I have worked various jobs at McMaster University in pursuit of my eventual goal of being a Professor of Engineering. I spent eight months as the head TA for a first year engineering course. From this work position, I noticed many segments of TAship that could be improved. I understand the significant role that a TA can play in a university student’s success in a course. Well designed software tools can definitely improve the impact of such TAs.\r\n\r\nI need no special technical requirements for my presentation. I plan on having a simple slideshow with no sound.\r\n",

    "title": "Thinking functionally: Introduction to FP in Python",
    "abstract": "Having studied Haskell and Prolog in my university, I was intrigued to learn more about Functional Programming! But when programming in Python gives so much flexibility, why bother about programming functionally...\nLet's explore it's merits and demerits and how we can apply to Python!",
    "description": "Python is an imperative language like Java or C++. An imperative language is based on 'commands', in the form of instructions and statements and are executed. These commands will have an effect. Functional languages like Haskell, OCaml revolve around the concept of 'pure functions'. A pure function is expressed as a mathematical expression only. You can evaluate the expression and there will be no side effects, for example, no I/O operations, no global state changes, no database interactions. The output is only dependent on its inputs. Hence, it is based on ‘equational reasoning’. So if you were to call a pure function with the same inputs a million times, you would get the same result every single time. Since there are no side effects, there is immutable data. The data once initialized remains same throughout the lifetime of the code, which makes 'parallel programming' easier. Due to this immutability of data, the value of an expression is the same anywhere it might occur in the program – as long as the required variables are defined. This is termed as 'Referential Transparency'. It means that the value of an expression is the same anywhere it might occur in the program – as long as the required variables are defined. You never need to track the value of state variables or remember any updates. This enables usage of 'memoization' – you basically ‘remember’ the outputs of expensive functions with some common arguments in a sort of lookup table. This reduces the computational complexity at the expense of memory.\r\n\r\nFunctions are dealt as 'first-class citizens', i.e, you can treat them as any other objects – you can assign them to variables, you can pass them as arguments, or even get them returned from other functions. 'Recursion' is the most important aspect of functional programming, since there are no loops (which prevents any side effects). 'Higher order functions' like map(), reduce() and filter() can take functions as arguments (or return them as results), providing parallelism over sequences. Partial function application, 'currying' and 'lazy evaluation' prevents loading entire data at once into the memory. All these features provide the advantage of code re-usability, less bugs, easy testing and parallelism.\r\n\r\nAlthough Python is not a functional programming language, but it has features suitable for writing a functional program. The three popular higher order functions are map(), reduce(), filter(). reduce() has now been moved to functools module, a part of the standard library. Next comes the lambda function, which has its roots in the Lambda Calculus. They are small anonymous functions not necessarily bound to a name at runtime. As far as recursion is concerned, any imperative code can be converted into a recursive function. The functions, operator and itertools module groups a number of functions (like iter()) related to iterators and their use/combination. Generator expressions to some extent do lazy evaluation, i.e. return an iterator that computes the values as necessary, not needing to materialize all the values at once. Yield expression is an example of this.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is no optimization for tail recursion in Python. In functional programming languages like Haskell, tail-recursive code is easily optimized into iterative code by the underlying compiler. In Python, it is impossible to separate pure and non-pure functions. Also, there is no pattern matching syntax. The variables are mutable. There is no function overloading mechanism. Moreover, there is only class-based type system. Lazy evaluation is also not fully supported.",

    "description": "Intro (1 minute):\r\n==============\r\nThe python community is filled with many people from many disciplines that learned python for all kinds of different reasons.  Not all of us took computer science in university, not all of us learned to code when we were 8.\r\n\r\nI work in post-production for film, I’ve been writing python every day at my job for two years now.  When I started I was pretty rusty. I’d taken a few courses in university, but hadn’t written anything substantive for a couple of years.  Getting good creeps up slowly.  Your first day on the job you’re not good, your second day, your third.  But I look at myself now and I’m writing full stack plugins.  How did I get here?  Am I good yet?  How many grains of sand make a heap?\r\n\r\nThe Aha moments, from veteran pythonistas (3 minutes):\r\n===============================================\r\n\r\nFeaturing quotes from my interviews with veteran coders:\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n+ Tell me a story about when you sucked.  \r\n+ What was the moment you knew you were getting kinda good at this thing?  \r\n+ What do you look for in others when gaging their python competence? \r\n\r\nThe answers to these three questions will frame the rest of the talk.  Question 1: talks about how you see yourself.  Coding is hard and we all start out sucking, we keep seeing ourselves as beginner programmers long after our skills outstripe this.  Question 2: how our code actually performs.  When does your curiosity/excitement get stronger than your fear or uncertainty, when do you start seeing efficiencies outside the scope of what your instructed to do.  Question 3: how others see your code.  Make your code reader friendly and your code reviews will be nicer, your coffee will taste sweeter, your coworkers will stop hissing when they see you.  Do future you a solid.\r\n\r\nHow you see yourself (1 minute):\r\n===========================\r\n\r\nWorking with your impostor syndrome\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n+ Some of it’s in your head, some of it isn’t\r\n+ Make smart friends.  If you’re the smartest person in the room, you’re doing something wrong.\r\n+ Embrace feeling dumb.  Being wrong now is an opportunity to be right later.  Be wrong early, be wrong often, learn from mistakes.\r\n+ The psychologist Carol Dweck talks about something called growth mindset.  Don’t be smart, do smart.  Look for opportunities to grow yourself rather than being ego protective about your coding skills\r\n\r\nHow your code performs (2 minutes)\r\n==============================\r\n+ Automate your little tasks! Then automate more! (this will include a short example from production)\r\n+ Write your own mandate!  If something isn’t strictly in your job description, but it will make your life easier, your team’s life easier?  Well just write that sucker.  Psychologist Amy Wrzesniewski writes about how individuals with higher job satisfaction engage in what she calls “job crafting”.\r\n\r\nHow others see your code (3 minutes):\r\n================================\r\n\r\nthree habits for leveling up, each of these will have short examples\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Write documentation!\r\n+ Docstrings and descriptive variables.  When you come back to something you wrote a year ago you’re going to be happy your variables aren’t called: var1, var2, var3.\r\n+ Use sphinx to auto-create documentation out of your docstrings!  Get in the habit of this and you’ll feel like a wizard!\r\n\r\n### Testing!\r\n+ I’ll have a short example using PyTest\r\n\r\n### Pep-8!\r\n+ Sure, formatting isn’t the sexiest part of coding, but when you look back at your clean, pretty code, it can make you feel polished in a way nothing else can.

    "description": "Software design is hard. That's why we invented design patterns. Design patterns abstract common approaches to problem solving into generic approaches that can be modified to suit the application at hand.\r\n\r\nMany of the design patterns in common use today are inspired by static object-oriented Enterprise languages like Java. These languages have a feature set that is somewhat more restrictive than Python's, and many design patterns are built to provide elegant ways around these restrictions.\r\n\r\nDesign patterns, like Dependency Injection, and the Visitor Pattern arise from restrictions on how you can pass code around at runtime. Other patterns, like Iterators, have been replaced by first-class language features of their own.\r\n\r\nAnd some patterns, like Threads just never worked at all.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll build up several design patterns, and then look at the Python features that make each pattern unnecessary. In doing so, you'll get a view into idiomatically translating code into Python, and a greater understanding of design decisions users of other languages need to make.",

We know we should automate our tests, but it takes time and effort. **pytest-bdd**, a plugin for the awesome **pytest** framework, makes it *much* easier to write tests by enabling Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) features. Using **pytest-bdd**, teams write tests in plain language using Gherkin (e.g., Given-When-Then steps), and then programmers write Python code to automate the steps. BDD testing is great because tests are self-documenting and steps abide by the DRY principle. And all the goodness of **pytest** is available. An example test could be:\r\n\r\n*Given* the DuckDuckGo home page is displayed\r\n*When* the user searches the phrase \"Python\"\r\n*Then* search results for \"Python\" are shown\r\n\r\nThis talk will teach how to use **pytest-bdd** to develop well-designed test scenarios and a robust automation framework.

    "description": "From January to March 2018, I took a leave of absence from my job in data engineering at Shopify to go work for the newly-formed Canadian Digital Service. CDS is a digital transformation office in the Canadian federal government, inspired by similar organizations such as 18F in the United States, GDS in the United Kingdom, and others.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll describe why I felt that taking a short leave of absence from a job I loved would be beneficial to my personal development, and whether or not it yielded the results I was looking for. I’ll also talk about how working to promote modern software development practices helped to crystallize the reasons we use them in my own mind.\r\n\r\nFinally, I’ll share a few lessons that I took back with me when I returned from CDS, and how they have impacted my work at Shopify.\r\n",

That said, I think that for the right people, taking a chance to spend some time with these groups can be remarkably personally fulfilling.\r\n\r\nI have given a similar talk at Shopify after returning from my sabbatical, and I will be giving a related talk at the Quality Summit 2018 in Calgary (Oct 2018).",

    "abstract": "If you have an evolving domain and process owners of varying expertise, then Domain Driven Design is a great approach. In this tutorial I would explain the concepts of DDD, and interactively introduce a Django project with a  \"drawing board to on board\" experience from mindset to implementation.",
    "description": "If you have evolving requirements, process owners of different specialities, and a complex business domain, then Domain Driven Design is an approach you can embrace. It is agnostic of tech-stack and paradigm, and is more of a philosophy and logic organization pattern than paradigm friendly design pattern. In this tutorial session I would like to do a more hands-on approach in building a system using Python and Django, starting from getting into the mind-set followed by modular code organization, inter-domain communication and all interim steps towards a project that is well understood by all steak holders. \r\n\r\nI would start with explaining the problem, let the audience choose roles and start a dialogue based process, and in that process, work through a ubiquitous language, bounded contexts, events, and a proposed structure in Django that helps with the right placements of the right tenants of DDD. The end product would be a small but functioning Django application that looks structurally different from common Django apps, but has more readability and extendability if the culture is centric to Domain Driven Design.\r\n\r\nDomain Driven Design has been touted as Object Oriented Programming done right, but it is not limited to the paradigm and has been used by functional languages and frameworks. Django, despite its monolith feel, can be rejigged into any model one wishes and with the right use case and motivation, beautiful engineering can ensue. This tutorial aims to interactively introduce just that.\r\n\r\nThe main focus is to have more of a \"drawing board to on board\" experience in this tutorial and while the one hour limit may be limiting for this, I would part with notes on looking further and invite to further contribute to the open source project and tools used.\r\n",
    "notes": "*Why Me?*\r\n\r\nI have been developing with Python/Django for over a decade and have experimented with various other languages when needs were felt. While I knew about Domain Driven Design back in school (around 2004), I never really experienced it till I made an accounting app using Grails in 2009. I have always felt Django could be a good vessel for it, despite its ActiveRecords affiliation and allegedly strict file structure. As I've checked out some talks (not too many though) and some open source codes (i.e. Taiga) I realized, it could be done. And ended up making a prototype app with Django that at first glance, looks like Phoenix, yet it's very much Django and leverages all the goodies thereof.\r\n\r\n*Modus Operandi*\r\n \r\nFollowing is the plan I intend to follow throughout the session:\r\n\r\nI would start off the session with introduction to Domain Driven Design and its cousins: Event Storming, CQRS, Event Sourcing. How to get into the habit of thinking in domains and communicating via the ubiquitous language will follow. Along the way, a pictorial overview of various concepts and terms of Domain Driven Design will be presented sans code/frameworks.\r\n\r\nIn the next step, I will explain the domain problem we will be solving, and how that problem normally would have been translated into Django would be explained, with all the common patterns of Django, it's ORM, and its file structure.\r\n\r\nUp next would be a restructuring of Django app and with the help of a code generator (open sourced earlier), have Django generate the context and its related modules as naturally as one would a normal Django app. Explanation of each module and how our particular thought process translates into those would be there.\r\n\r\nNext step is where interactivity will start and audience will participate in the engineering process. This could introduce some tools, whiteboarding mechanism and (perhaps virtual) sticky notes for event storming. The workflow will be translated into codes and subsequent compilation.\r\n\r\nFinally, possibilities of involving advanced concepts will take place, along with reasoning of GraphQL, SQLAlchemy, reporting etc. Role of Event Sourcing and CQRS would get a fleeting mention along with limitation of Django in this context. Domain Driven Design isn't really a silver bullet so the limitation of the process will also be talked about. Domain Driven Design is a renewed interest of mine and I enjoy contributing to the concept whenever I get a chance. This included some discussion and a more recent talk on Domain Driven Design in Phoenix in a meet-up at FunctionalTO\r\n\r\n*System Requirements*\r\n\r\nThe participants would need to have their own laptops along with Python 3 and PIP installed. Paper and Pencil (or Pen) would be helpful to sketch out the plans. Participants with some professional experience with Django, or a similar framework would best be benefited from it. ",

This talk is targeted at attendees with familiarity with computer vision interested in an learning to leverage deep learning with small amounts of data, or applying computer vision to text documents.",
    "description": "Abstract\r\nWith the advent of large, pre-trained, neural networks for object detection, it’s pretty straightforward to leverage transfer learning, and train a model that can recognize cats, hot dogs, or anything you please. But what about when you’re trying to detect the ABSENCE of an object?\r\n\r\nLet’s say you’re given a mass of contracts, and you want to train a model that can tell which ones have been signed and which haven’t. You label all the signatures and create a train/test split. You download the weights for Resnet or Inception, set your classes, choose your hyperparameters, and you’re off to the races. Your final model can find signatures on a page with 95% precision and recall.\r\n\r\nYou still haven’t solved the original problem — finding the unsigned documents. To do this, you need to go further and treat the absence of a signature as an object in itself. That’ll get you part of the way there. To achieve the highest possible accuracy, we’ve used a couple of task-specific features: optical character recognition (like banks use to read checks at ATMs), and page length data. This has allowed us to achieve very high accuracy even with only 3,000 labeled examples. We’ve also successfully extended the solution beyond the realm of binary classification into object localization.",

But in a digitalized world, I realized I needed code to produce in-depth stories. Since then, I've learned Python and I am now working from Montreal, as data reporter, my dream job!",
    "description": "I've learned how to code in Python in 2015, while doing a Master's Degree in data and investigative journalism at the University of King's College, in Halifax.\r\n\r\nSince then, I used Python in dozens of exclusive stories. During my talk, I would explain why code gives me a big advantage in my job, with concrete examples of published projects. In a few words, code gives me the ability to automate many things and to dive deep into a topic, with huge amount of data. The scale of my stories is often out of reach for non-coder reporters.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n- Quebecers always say that wine is cheaper in Ontario. To check whether it was true, I've scraped the data from the Société des alcools du Québec and the Liquor Control Board of Ontario. Then, I compared the prices for similar products. And consumers were right! Hundreds of wine bottles were less expensive to buy in Ontario, according to my report, which was the largest analysis ever made on the topic.\r\n\r\n- In Quebec, the Ministry of Education has the duty to regularly inspect child care services. I scraped the data from all inspections since 2009 and analyzed it. Conclusion: half of the child cares centers haven't been inspected in the last 5 years! I wrote several exclusive stories with this data.\r\n\r\n- During the federal campaign of 2015, we talked a lot about military vehicles sold to Saudi Arabia. I decided to get the details of all military exportations for the last 25 years. I cross-referenced the data with several databases and discovered that a third of all Canadian military exportations were sold to dictatorships, since 1990.\r\n\r\n- In four years, the liberal government of Philippe Couillard, in Quebec, made a lot of changes to the tax system. I compiled all the changes and created a chatbot to help people determine whether it made them save or lose money. This bot involved a lot of HTML and JavaScript. So I created a Python script to code the HTML and JavaScript for me!\r\n\r\n- How universities should be financed is an ongoing debate in Quebec. I obtained the detailed financial data of all Quebec universities for the period 1997-2016  (even if the government didn't want me to access it). Then I published an exclusive story on the incredible rise of \"special\" fees (+178% in 20 years) billed to students and the lack of expenses for new professors.\r\n\r\nI am also always trying to learn something new. I've just finished a class on Coursera on machine learning. I am thinking about doing a story using TensorFlow in the coming months!",

But French works too. ;)\r\n\r\nI think I am one of the best person to talk about code and journalism because... there's just a handful of coder reporter! Hahaha!

In [the Law of Leaky Abstractions](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/) Joel Spolsky makes the case that abstracting away the low-level stuff prevents us from learning important concepts.\r\n\r\nSo let's learn about WSGI.\r\n\r\nWSGI is the Web Server Gateway Interface and it's the foundation of almost every Python web framework.

    "abstract": "Library maintainers, how can you innovate without breaking projects that depend on you? Follow semantic versioning, add APIs conservatively, add parameters compatibly, write an upgrade guide, use DeprecationWarnings, and publish a deprecation policy. Break backwards compatibility rarely and wisely.",
    "description": "I won't do Q \u0026 A during the time slot, but I'll encourage people to come talk with me in the hallway afterward.\r\n\r\n(1 minute) Good library maintainers keep their promises to the people who depend on them: they release bugfixes, add useful new features, and continue to innovate. Perhaps most importantly, they never introduce backward-breaking changes unexpectedly. How can you be a good library maintainer and ensure you simultaneously innovate and preserve compatibility?\r\n\r\n(5 minutes) The bedrock of library compatibility is semantic versioning: it's a convention that communicates with version numbers whether a release contains bugfixes, new features, or compatibility-breaking changes. Tools like \"pip\" understand semantic version numbers, and PEP 440 defines the syntax for version numbers.\r\n\r\n(5 minutes) You can reduce the need for backward-breaking changes by keeping your API as small as possible. Make no public method, class, function, or attribute without a good reason. Adding more public APIs is easy, after all, but removing them is painful. If you don't know whether a feature is worth supporting forever, introduce it as \"provisional\" to gauge interest.\r\n\r\n(5 minutes) Add parameters compatibly. New positional parameters must have default values and be placed at the end of the parameter list. Adding new keyword arguments is less risky, which is why Python 3 introduces syntax for keyword-only arguments. Future-proof your functions and methods using this new syntax.\r\n\r\n(5 minutes) Sometimes in the course of human events it becomes necessary to make incompatible changes. Be conservative: the more effort you demand from your existing users, the less likely they are to upgrade. In the worst case you can be stuck in the same predicament as the Python team, maintaining both versions for many years. Compare each change's benefit to its cost.\r\n\r\n(8 minutes) If you choose to break compatibility, treat your users gently. First implement the new API and raise a DeprecationWarning from the old API, and wait for the next major release before deleting the old API. This method allows your users to rewrite their code incrementally. Plus, they will be able to test changes to their code, and changes in your library, independently from each other and isolate the cause of bugs. Publish a deprecation policy document that explains how you will maintain your library's API, and teach users how to check for DeprecationWarnings and update their code as your library evolves.\r\n\r\n(1 minute) Conclusion: If you follow these steps you will act as a trustworthy maintainer for your library's users, while preserving your freedom to innovate.",

    "description": "Last winter, CBC News shocked sports fans by revealing that nearly half of all tickets for the Blue Jays home opener were listed on resale websites, priced at more than 50 percent above their face value. Behind it, all was a Python bot sent to monitor ticket rollouts from the primary box-office all the way to a half-dozen resale sites. The program then combined that data into a single tracking system that created a virtual map of the stadium, monitoring how each seat therein moved from primary to reseller markets and eventually turned into a fan sitting in the seat.\r\n\r\nCBC News developer William Wolfe-Wylie and data journalist Valerie Ouellet take you deep inside their Python-operated ticket monitoring machine.\r\n\r\nFor the first time since the start of their investigation, William and Valerie will lay out a step-by-step explanation of their workflow, including how they organized, cleaned and structured their raw data, collaborated with a team of journalists to ensure findings led the project and found creative ways to visualize their data.\r\n\r\n*William Wolfe-Wylie* is a senior developer with CBC News.

    "abstract": "Each soccer game is played only once. For fans, that's great! For data scientists, it's an inadequate sample size. This talk will explore various tactics I've employed to simulate soccer games in an effort to better understand the underlying dynamics of the game.",
    "description": "While soccer is a complex game of tactics and technique, individual game results are often decided by moments that frequently seem to be equal parts genius and fortune. Leading analytics experts have claimed that \"football is driven more by luck and chance than other team sport”. It’s the fighting chance of the underdog team, and their occasional victory, that keeps soccer fans captivated across the world.\r\n\r\nHowever, for the data scientists tasked with analyzing a game where it’s well understood that the better team doesn’t always win, the result of a single game (or frequently, an entire season) isn’t a sufficient sample size to prove anything worthwhile.\r\n\r\nBy modeling the decision making tendencies of players as individual agents, grouping them into teams, and simulating games on a pass-by-pass granularity, we can quickly generate a large sample of fake games derived from similar starting conditions.\r\n\r\nWhile this data is fake, it’s value is tangible. Not only can you see how likely either team is to win the match, you’re able to uncover tactical strengths and weaknesses that only present themselves only through the interaction between particular teams. These insights, while derived entirely from fabricated data, can provide immense value to a team’s decision making process.",

Where we used to be required to use C/C++ (commonly in the Arduino environment), we can now use Python.\r\n\r\nMicroPython is a new, opensource implementation of Python3 for this type of environment, including the BBC Micro:bit.  CiruitPython is a fork of MicroPython that supports new hardware and provides a very beginner/learner friendly way to deploy code to the hardware: connect your board via USB and a drive appears, drop code onto the drive and it runs. Edit code directly on the drive. Save it and it runs. Connect to the board via a terminal emulator (e.g. screen) and you can drop into a Python REPL. A recent addition has been a compatibility layer for Raspberry Pi making CircuitPython code portable between the various microcontroller systems and the Pi.\r\n\r\nThe talk will introduce CircuitPython and various boards from Adafruit that support it as well as the Mu python programmign environment that has support for CircuitPython and associated hardware.\r\n\r\nThere will be live demos.",
    "notes": "All that is required from the audience is a basic familiarity with Python and an interest in working at the hardware level.\r\n\r\nI've been working with computer hardware and software for 35 years, in many language, domains, and companies.  But never Python. From my first encounter with the language I had a strong negative reaction. I know Guido somewhat, and even invited him to talk about Python at on company I was consulting at. I took Python classes when I worked at Google that Alex Martelli was involved with. It didn't change my view.\r\n\r\nUntil I started getting involved with Adafruit and discovered CircuitPython. It's like the wild west. You can't just think \"Python.. meh.. I can use Common Lisp, or Haskell, ...\"  The options are more constrained. You can use C or C++, or maybe Forth. There are a couple toyish Lisp interpreters. But that's it. Micro/Circuit-Python are the quickest, most fun way to write embedded code at the moment. It's become the first thing I reach for when I start a project.\r\n\r\nFor the past year I've been making projects and writing for learn.adafruit.com. By now my projects are either just CircuitPython or aren't really complete until there's a CicruitPython version of the code.\r\n\r\nYou can see my work at https://learn.adafruit.com/users/dastels as well as in HackSpace magazine (https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/).

(subclass, isinstance, is, type, obj.property, hasattr, class.__name__, try/catch).\r\n\r\n# Mapping Relationships Between Categories of Types [10 mins]\r\nA hypothesis will be stated that all object types can be binned into one of four bins (Builtin, Library-Supplied, Developer/User-Created, External).  We define \"External\", as a means to explain non-python representations of objects in some other system (eg. JSON, a Database).  A few cherry-picked examples will be shared of the more complex relationships where python has a builtin type, that do not map 1:1 to external types, and highlighted with how libraries have attempted to fill in the gap.  (Eg. Dates \u0026 Time)  I'll show how messy this can get over time as technical debt adds up.  I'll posit a phenomenon named \"The Mandatory Type Mapping Principle\" to explain what I mean by the fact that type mappings happen \"Every. Single. Time.\"\r\n\r\n# Mapping Maintaining Rule Engine [10 mins]\r\nThe API and object model for a proprietary rule engine is shared.  The maintainability has proven the API to be extremely robust.  It's also defendably beautiful, explicit, flat, readable, and finished (ie PEP 20 compliant).\r\n\r\n# Context in Pensions [5 mins]\r\nExperiences will be shared in the context of a developer's workflow from the perspective of a developer, and a manager of developers, at one of Canada's largest asset managers. \r\n\r\n# Questions [3 mins]\r\nYou know...if I don't run out of time.",
    "notes": "# What is type punning?\"\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_punning\r\n\r\n# More about Me\r\nI'm an extremely passionate python developer, a casual contributor to open source projects and consider myself in tune with the ecosystem.  English is my first language.  Plus, I've taken professional public speaking courses.   To quote one of my peers \"Any time you're going to give a talk, on anything, please invite me\". I believe I can share a competitive and new idea, that might benefit other people.  I also wrote 99% of the library which implements the ideas.  \r\n\r\n# Bigger Picture\r\nIf this talk proves successful it will help me a) connect with devs who might want jobs in the industry and b) encourage my employer to open source this code, laying a precedent for more tools to follow in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "Your first experience with Flask was probably writing a function that returned a string. Flask got a request from your browser, called the function, and returned the string as a response. Even when you build more complex applications, you may not get more complicated than that. But Flask contains a rich internal API for controlling how a request moves through the application and becomes a response, and it's possible to override or extend every part.\r\n\r\nThis talk will explore the path a request takes through, from being received from the WSGI server to building a response. See how routing, the request context, event handlers, signals, error handlers, the response formatter, extensions, and middleware all play a part behind the scenes in turning your Python function into a web application. Some common entry points for customization will be demonstrated, but the focus is on the overall execution path.\r\n\r\nFlask (and Django, etc.) may seem magical, but they all follow a fundamental set of steps and rules. Demystify Flask and take control of your application.",

However, a team will not communicate effectively if a team that has been taken apart and separated due to disconnection and lack of communication. \r\n\r\nAs with all teams, each team was placed together because at the initial conception of the team; it was assumed that the team element is within the excellent working order.  However, the appreciation of the team model must be well-oiled, and if not, members of the team will individually lack the proper function that is necessitated for TEAMWORK and fail to produce. \r\n\r\nRESEARCH HAS PROVEN THAT THE KEY CATALYST REGARDING TEAM FAILURE IS COMMUNICATION AND THE LACK OF PROPER USAGE OF ONE’S COMMUNICATION SKILLS.\r\n\r\nBy using ACTIVE LISTENING SKILLS (ALS), a method developed by the FBI, every team member will increase productivity regarding their specific missions, and when united, the team members will form successful finalization of their team-goal.  By applying ALS, the team’s entire task will be the result of a collective productive representation of their work.\r\n\r\nStacey’s experience as a Scholar (Forensic Psychology), Adjunct Professor (Group Dynamics/Psychology), and Hostage Negotiator has allowed him the ability to create a method for CIVILIANS to use regarding the application of Communication Skills.\r\n\r\nThe attendees will take with them SKILLS used by Hostage/Crisis Negotiators, which have been Converted for personal, business, and everyday use.\r\n\r\nKey Takeaways:\r\n\r\n*Minimal Reassurances (Building rapport and encourage individuals to continue talking):\r\n\r\nAttendees will learn to use sounds especially on the phone, to let one person know the other is there and listening.  Such as, “Oh?” “When?” and “Really?”\r\n \r\nAttendees will learn to utilize these forms of questions, comments, or sounds that do not interfere with the flow of conversation but will let the other individual know that you are there and listening.\r\n \r\n*Paraphrasing (This skill clarifies content, highlights issues and promotes a give and take between you and another, it tends to make the other individual a better listener):\r\n\r\nAttendees will appreciate the skill of summarizing what they have just heard and repeated it back in their own words.\r\n \r\nThe skill demonstrates listening, creates responsiveness and establishes rapport because it is evident that you have heard and understood.\r\n \r\nUsually, paraphrasing begins with the words, “Are you telling me…” “Are you saying…” or “So, what your saying is….\r\n \r\n*Mirroring/Reflecting (useful when you are at a loss for words)\r\n\r\nAttendees will learn to use this skill when they need clarification.\r\n \r\nThe skill provides an opportunity for the individual to think about what you have said.\r\n \r\nThis skill allows the listener to asks for more input without guiding the direction of the other individual’s thoughts\r\n \r\nThis skill elicits information when you do not have enough to ask a pertinent question.\r\n \r\n*Open-Ended Questions (The primary use of this skill is to get individuals to talk)\r\n\r\nAttendees will learn to encourage individuals to say more without directing the conversation.\r\n \r\nThis skill is used to have your questions answered with more than just a “yes” or “no.”\r\n \r\nThis skill gets information using fewer questions, they typically begin with: how, what, when and where.\r\n \r\nAttendees will discover how to avoid using Closed-end questions such as “why.”\r\n\r\n“Why” questions tend to steer the conversation toward blame and shut down communication.\r\n \r\n“Why” questions also tend to pass judgment.\r\n \r\nThis skill gives a feeling of interrogation that makes rapport building difficult and causes you to work harder at thinking up new questions.\r\n \r\n*“I” Messages (Used when communication is difficult and intense):\r\n\r\nThe attendees will discover that “I” messages enable them to let the other individual know how he/she is making you feel, why you think that way, and what the other individual can do to remedy the situation.\r\n\r\n“When you said that, I feel….”  or “I feel…. when you said….”\r\n\r\n*Effective Pauses (Silence)\r\n\r\nThe attendees will develop this skill to use when emphasizing their point.\r\n \r\nSilence can be very useful on several levels because most people are not comfortable with silence and will fill it with talk. \r\n \r\nThe attendees will discover to use silence just before or just after saying something important.\r\n \r\nNOTE:\r\n\r\n*This lecture/workshop can last from 30 minutes to 1.5 hours. \r\n*The lecture is approximately 30 minutes.\r\n*The workshop is 1 hour.\r\n \r\n*The workshop consists of PARTICIPATION from the attendees, using ROLE PLAYING scenarios to give them an authentic feel applying their skills.\r\n\r\nFurther, if time is not permitted for a 1.5-hour session, at least 1 ROLE PLAYING scenario will be implemented into the 30-minute lecture.\r\n\r\nShould you have further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. \r\nBest regards,\r\nStacey M. Jenkins, M. Psych\r\ncrux.conception@gmail.com\r\n260.715.2685",

    "description": "•We talk about protecting data.\r\n•We talk about outside forces seeking to obtain our data by unconventional means.\r\n•I will speak about PROTECTING or DATA that is stolen from trusted individuals within.\r\n\r\nIndividuals such as:\r\n\r\nEDWARD J. SNOWDEN The media hails him as a “whistleblower,” but MR. SNOWDEN stole DATA belonging to the NSA and disseminated said data to individuals with unauthorized access.\r\n\r\n•William Binney (NSA) •Jose Ignacio Lopez (GM) Chief of productions accused of corporate espionage. •Steven Louis Davis (Gillette) Pled guilty to theft of trade secrets\r\n\r\n•Patricia Dunn (Hewlett-Packard) Involved in a spying scandal\r\n\r\n•Ross Klein and Amar Lalvani (Starwood Hotels) downloaded confidential Starwood information to use later at Hilton.\r\n\r\nMY PRESENTATION WILL ENGAGE THE AUDIENCE:\r\nWe will focus on their psychological motivations, to identify the emotional precursors.\r\nCombining open-discussions, media, and PowerPoints, to illustrate, cultural adaptation, borderline personality disorder, psychological autopsy, precursors to ESPIONAGE, and SPYING.\r\n\r\nThe presentation will give participants innovative insights to conduct psychological field profile/assessments and verify potential risk factors.  This presentation will outline the mental aspects regarding a Data Breaching and possible prevention Data Loss.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this presentation will demonstrate that with the proper preparation, one can evaluate an individual whose psychological profile dictates that they retain the potential to perform CORPORATE ESPIONAGE.\r\n\r\nOne of the most severe threats facing our Businesses and Corporations is the threat of a DATA BREACH. Regardless of the motivation, nature of their associated tactics, techniques, and procedures; the breach in DATA pose a stiff challenge to the existence of your organizations future. \r\n\r\nThe persistent nature of this threat and the expectation that it will continue to rank as the most likely scenario; Board executives and administrators will need to contend with soon.\r\nThe goal of my presentation is to inform Executives/Administrators key signs to help reduce/prevent DATA loss using corporate espionage and theft.\r\n\r\nMy workshop will contain two main sections:\r\n•\tThe first section will discuss the PSYCHOLOGY of spy/thief,\r\n•\tThe second section will deal with the process of identifying individuals who seek to harm the company.\r\n\r\nThe first section will cover a brief history of CORPORATE ESPIONAGE and incidents involving same.\r\n\r\nThe psychological concepts behind DATA BREACHES (within) and CORPORATE will be discussed thoroughly.\r\n\r\nFor this segment, I will be utilizing role-playing scenarios to introduce to the PARTICIPANTS how “everyday people skills” can be used to conduct a Criminal/Psychological profile to aid in determining potential corporate spies/thieves.\r\n \r\n\r\nThat said, executives should safeguard administrative tools for their company to complement its data security effectively. The Board of directors and its administration treat the protection of their data to warrant the risk of a breach of data, and this includes PERSONNEL.\r\n\r\nIn today's world of CYBER-RISK and CYBER-SECURITY, we sometimes forget about the individuals, or dare I say SUSPECTS behind the BREACH, ATTACH or THEFT. We neglect these individuals until it is too late, and the damage has been done.\r\nIndividuals such as:\r\n\r\nEDWARD J. SNOWDEN\r\nThe media hails him as a “whistleblower,” but MR. SNOWDEN stole DATA belonging to the NSA and disseminated said data to individuals with unauthorized access.\r\n\r\n•William Binney (NSA)\r\n•Jose Ignacio Lopez (GM)\r\n Chief of productions accused of corporate espionage.\r\n•Steven Louis Davis (Gillette)\r\nPled guilty to theft of trade secrets\r\n\r\n•Patricia Dunn (Hewlett-Packard)\r\n \tInvolved in a spying scandal\r\n\r\n•Ross Klein and Amar Lalvani (Starwood Hotels)\r\ndownloaded confidential Starwood information to use later at Hilton.\r\n\r\nThis second section will focus more on people reading skills and identifying micro-expressions.\r\nThis segment of the workshop will help the PARTICIPANTS identify the traits, behaviors, and body language of individuals.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion at the end the second section will consist of a hands-on practice session:\r\nI will ask PARTICIPANTS to apply what they have learned by identifying potential RISKS by profiling random social media accounts of individual, based on photographs, social media postings, likes, friends, and so forth.\r\n\r\n• Note: not only have past participants found this method fun, but they have also found it to be reliable and proven reliable. I utilize this method throughout my profiles of gang members, narcotics traffickers, white-collar criminals and more.\r\n\r\nThe protection of a company's data is not just an issue for the IT department. Data security is a crucial element of a corporation's security mainframe, necessitating executive surveillance. The breach of data has immediate licit consequences, which executives must comprehend.\r\n\r\nThe topic of data security must be addressed in every board meeting and said boards should be equipped with the tools to obtain proficiency, which will allow them to encounter with matters surrounding data security.\r\n\r\nMY PRESENTATION WILL ENGAGE THE AUDIENCE:\r\nTherefore, for this workshop, we will combine open-discussions, media, and PowerPoints, to illustrate, cultural adaptation, borderline personality disorder, psychological autopsy, precursors to ESPIONAGE, and SPYING.\r\n\r\nThe presentation is fun, excite, informative and addictive.\r\n\r\nFurther, the presentation is lengthy (but not dry nor ever dull), it averages about 1.5 hours.  However, it can be condensed to approximately 45 minutes.  What I would do (and this involves summarizing all my lectures/presentations) is to reduce my open discussions (Q\u0026A from the audience) and limit my role-playing scenarios. \r\n\r\nHowever, the role-play segment gets the attendees involved and some even attempt to test their new-found aptitudes soon after.  For example, some would attempt to use said skills while at dinner, lounge, and so forth.  However, it can be reduced to one or two “mock-type scenarios.”\r\n \r\nThis segment is vital because it proves sound regarding the utilization of one’s everyday skills to psychologically profile. \r\n\r\nI have used this method in the past regarding COLD HOMICIDE CASES, PREPARATIONS before INTERVIEWING SUSPECTS and PROFILING current cases. \r\n\r\nThis lecture/presentation will conform to discussions regarding cyber-attacks/incidents and will entail the psychological unmasking of individuals behind the attacks.\r\n\r\nFor example; a car thief would look at the vulnerability of the anti-theft system protecting a vehicle.  However, how does that thief know what weaknesses to look for, the same goes for\r\n\r\nThe necessity for societal psychosomatic tactics is also suggested by the fact that significant cybersecurity episodes from motivations as wide-ranging as monetary profit and radical/philosophical dissent.

Combining open-discussions, media, and PowerPoints, to illustrate, cultural adaptation, borderline personality disorder, psychological autopsy, precursors to ESPIONAGE, and SPYING.  The presentation/workshop will give participants innovative insights to conduct psychological field profile/assessments and verify potential risk factors.  The presentation/workshop will outline the psychological aspects regarding a Data Breaching and possible prevention Data Loss.  Furthermore, this presentation/workshop will demonstrate that with the proper preparation, one can evaluate an individual whose psychological profile dictates that they retain the potential to perform CORPORATE ESPIONAGE.\r\n\r\nWe talk about protecting data; we talk about outside forces seeking to obtain our data by unconventional means.  My Presentation/Workshop will speak about PROTECTING or DATA that is stolen from trusted individuals within.  One of the most severe threats facing our Businesses and Corporations is the threat of a DATA BREACH. Regardless of the motivation, nature of their associated tactics, techniques, and procedures; the breach in DATA pose a severe challenge to the existence of your organizations future. The persistent nature of this threat and the expectation that it will continue to rank as the most likely scenario; Board executives and administrators will need to contend with soon.  The goal of my presentation is to inform Executives/Administrators key signs to help reduce/prevent DATA loss using corporate espionage and theft.  ",

    "title": "Clean architecture in Python",
    "abstract": "We have been building our web applications with DB in the centre of the design for years. While saving data cannot be ignored, one may lose track of business rules along the way if they concentrate on ORM models. Clean Architecture puts business value in the 1st place, letting think outside the box.",
    "description": "Your database is not your application. Neither are ORM models or even your framework. They are not reasons for building yet another project. The real motivation is to satisfy some business needs. Unfortunately, it might get out of sight due to years spent on writing Django- or Rails-like web applications. Their ORMs usually dominates in applications, coupling business logic to the framework and making it impossible to (unit) test it without database access. The fact is you can develop and test features without even thinking about how business objects map into database tables. Software engineering brought several solutions over the last few years, and I want to share with you one of them, called Clean Architecture.\r\n\r\nClean Architecture is an approach that puts your customer’s concerns in the centre of your software. All other issues, such as persistence are treated as implementation details. This is achieved thanks to a careful layering of the project. There are a few interesting outcomes. Firstly, the business rules layer knows nothing about a framework or a database. Therefore you can develop and test all business logic without saving results anywhere. Secondly, upgrading or even swapping a framework is less painful. The same is true for every third-party service as they are abstracted away. Thirdly, Clean Architecture makes introducing new team members to the project much simpler since everything has its place. Last, but certainly not least - as time passes and project grows Clean Architecture lets you maintain order remain flexible.\r\n",
    "notes": "This talk is intended to inform the community about an alternative architectural approach that will substantially benefit projects with a rich business domain.\r\n\r\nWhat makes me a right guy to talk about this? I have developed a few projects in Python using this approach. I’ve been studying software engineering books for several past years, for example, Domain Driven Design by Eric Evans, Implementing DDD by Vaugh Vernon or Clean Architecture by Robert C Martin just to name few. I am obsessed with code quality and testability. I also love to teach and share new ideas with people. Besides, I am writing a book on Clean Architecture and Python.\r\n",

For a startup like us, the tools we adopt need to be well-maintained, easy to use, cost effective and ideally open source. Tavern fits the bill, and is also a pytest plugin, which is a huge plus as well. \r\n\r\nIn this tutorial, we will cover how to get started with Tavern, how to write basic tests, how to leverage the power of pytest fixtures, and how to use external functions to make more powerful tests. Participants should walk away from the workshop with a solid understanding of how to use Tavern for API testing. ",
    "notes": "A friend recommended Tavern to me after a small discussion regarding API testing. Since then, I've fell in love with how simple and concise Tavern is, and would like to help spread the word about it. I've given this same tutorial at PyCon Thailand last June, and would like to do it again but with a different audience and a more in-depth tutorial on the topic this time.\r\n\r\nI saw your note above regarding Financial Assistance, and if selected, it would go a long way since I will be flying from the Philippines to attend this conference. :) Thank you and looking forward to hearing from you soon!",
