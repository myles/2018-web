talk_abstract: "Teaching computational thinking in the classroom is a challenge as there's a wide range of skills, including the teacher's.
The Gigglebot is a microbit rover that covers the steps from no coding to Python coding through a variety of approaches so that no one in the classroom gets left behind."

talk_details: "Teaching kids to code can be challenging, especially in a classroom environment. Some are good typists because they come from tech savvy families, and some have only ever swiped their iPhone screens, while others have no tech at home. Competitive robotics can be scary for some, while non-competitive robotics usually get their interest. Bringing non-competitive robotics into the classroom opens up coding to all, but textual code can be daunting.  

The [Gigglebot](https://gigglebot.io) is a Micro:Bit based rover that covers the transition from zero code to Python code, by offering first a block based interface with [MakeCode](https://makecode.microbit.org/), then a Python-based interface [Edublocks](https://microbit.edublocks.org/), then an editor with hand-holding tutorials [Firia Labs](https://make.firialabs.com/), and finally a beginner friendly Python editor [Mu editor](https://codewith.mu/) when the kids are ready to handle Python.

This approach allows for the greatest flexibility in the classroom where kids can be found with different levels of tech expertise. Projects can be done in any and all of those tools, thus leveling the playing field, and letting everyone develop their computational thinking and problem solving skills."
