talk_details: "# Abstract

Zero to API is a tutorial to help beginners create an authenticated API from scratch using Django, Django Rest Framework and Restauth.

# Description

This is a beginner tutorial that helps users get up and running with Django and Django Rest Framework with the goal of creating an authenticated API. Since API's are essential for mobile and web apps, this tutorial is a way to help beginner pythonistas get their app users logged in, and use authentication on each request for their API. It will lead them through creating a Django project, installing the packages required, creating the authentication and then ultimately going through a basic Django project to create an authenticated API. It will also lead attendees through using some useful tools for testing and debugging Restful APIs on their own.
This course has been presented before at the Edmontonpy meetup to a crowd of 30-40 pythonistas, in June 2018. A link to the tutorial is [here](https://github.com/dgmouris/zero_to_api).
