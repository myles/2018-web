    speaker_description='<p>PyCon Canada Development Sprints are two days of intensive learning and development on an open source project of your choice, in a team environment. It’s a time to come together with colleagues, old and new, to share what you’ve learned and apply it to an open source project.</p><p> PyCon Canada provides the space and infrastructure (network, power, tables & chairs); you bring your skills, humanity, and brainpower (oh! and don’t forget your computer).<br/> Some of things you might end up doing during the sprint: <br/>
<ul>
<li>Fix bugs
<li>Write tests
<li>Improve documentation
<li>Write code
</ul>
<p>It’s a great way to contribute to the community, learn about coding and open-source contribution, and have fun!<br/> To learn more about some of the projects that are taking place during the Sprint days, check out our wiki: <a href="https://github.com/pyconca/2018-wiki/wiki/Sprints">https://github.com/pyconca/2018-wiki/wiki/Sprints</a></p>'
